    "#doc = 'This is episode number 682 with Mico Yuk, host of the Analytics On Fire podcast.Welcome back to the SuperDataScience Podcast. Today I\\'m lucky to be joined by Mico Yuk. A straight shooter who pulls absolutely no punches in her assessment of, well of anything, but particularly about vendors in the data analytics space. Mico is host of the popular Analytics on Fire podcast, which has a cult following. She co-founded the BI Brainz group and analytics, consulting and solutions company that has taught over 15,000 students analytics, visualization, and data storytelling courses, including at major multinationals like Nestle, FedEx, and Proctor & Gamble. She authored the Data Visualization for Dummies book and is a sought-after keynote speaker and TV news commentator.In this episode, Mico details her BI, business intelligence and analytics framework that persuades executives with data storytelling. She fills us in on what the top BI tools are on the market today, and the BI trends she\\'s observed that could predict the most popular BI tools of upcoming years. All right, let\\'s jump right into our conversation.Mico, welcome to the SuperDataScience Podcast. I\\'ve been trying to get you on the show for ages, and now you\\'re finally here. Where in the world are you calling in from? I\\'m from hot Atlanta, Georgia. I\\'ve never been to Atlanta, but I\\'ve heard good things. Yeah, I mean, we have a lot going on here. I don\\'t know if you saw, we recently got the FIFA and the Olympics coming here, so like, construction is in and traffic is insanity. Not that we need more, but like we, we\\'ve got, we got awarded both, so it\\'s- Yeah, I do know- It\\'s [inaudible] here.Jon Krohn:It\\'s the longest commute in America on average. So I\\'m like you, like we were talking before the show. I live on one road and I just go back and forth. I, I\\'ve, you know, in Atlanta you have to do it for your sanity. Yeah. So I had you recommended to me as a guest by several people, and I think the last person of at least three people that recommended you was Kate Strachnyi, who\\'s a wonderful person in the data community. And so on the third recommendation, I was like, all right, we\\'re doing this right away. And then it took a while to get you booked. You\\'re a very tough, a very hot ticket in town down in hot Atlanta, but we\\'ve now finally pulled it off and you\\'re here. So you\\'re the host of the Analytics on Fire podcast. Yes, sir. It has been, and it may even be still today, the number one podcast in analytics. You are in the top 2% globally across all podcasts, including like all the mainstream podcasts out there, which is wild. And you have somewhat of a cult following. So I understand you can tell us a bit more about this, but when you go to conferences, you have people coming up to you. Yeah. Tell us about it.Mico Yuk:Yeah, so Analytics On Fire is a cult. It\\'s no longer a podcast. That\\'s what we call it, a cult. Then, because I will go to conferences and because we didn\\'t produce like t-shirts and cups, people will print their own things, come up and be like, \"Hey, Mico, like, I\\'ve been watching you for like, how many years and I have my cup with me cuz I knew you were here.\" Or their t-shirts or like, you know, I have people that will like walk up and many times and be like, \"Oh, when I started my job, your podcast was mandatory to my job\". So, you know, because we\\'re like your podcast, we\\'re like, you know, educational. We bring in leaders, taught leaders like yourself, and they talk about topics that are relevant that can really help people. So the whole premise of it is that we do no bs. So there\\'s no fluff on our podcast. We tell it as it is good and bad. So I think people appreciate that, you know, there\\'s no marketing. Yeah. You are famously no bs. That\\'s one thing that I know about you for sure. Yeah. Perfect. So speaking of educational, you also co-founded an organization called BI Brainz, like Business Intelligence Brains, but the Brains has a \"Z\" on the end, or Z depending on where you\\'re in the world. Yeah, we won\\'t talk about The Jerk Off. That wouldn\\'t sell us the one with the S cuz he\\'s known name. Oh, okay. I see.Mico Yuk:[inaudible] All right. S or not, BI Brainz has been a big hit. You\\'ve had 15,000 students use some kind of education from the platform. So you have online students, but also in-person trainings. And so you\\'ve had seven-figure revenue for the online course alone, eight-figure revenue if you include the other kinds of training. Consulting, yep. Yeah, consulting. And so I understand that a big part of what BI Brainz teaches is your BIDS framework. This is the B I D S framework, which is the BI slash analytics data storytelling framework. And so the idea here is it\\'s a framework for allowing data storytelling, data visualization to persuade decision makers, right? Correct. So I started off as a consultant and enterprise quickly rose up to top 1%. So I worked in New York, I think I told you that on 42nd and second quickly became like top 1% in the world in that, in that field. And then realized that like I went through so much that I wanted to help other people in the enterprises basically go through what I didn\\'t go through. And so I actually developed a framework to help people that were like me. Didn\\'t know it become such a hit, let\\'s be honest. Like I put it out there and I was like, oh, you know, I\\'m going to put it out there before, you know, community and all this stuff. And then, you know, who knew there were so many people like me that were really struggling with this. You know, just we were, we had data visualizations, we had reports, but it\\'s like, how do you tell the story? Like, how do I get Jon to make a decision because putting a chart in front of Jon is not working. Right? And so crafting that story and created a framework around that, particularly for enterprises where there\\'s all these complexities and diplomacy and all that stuff that became a hit. So it was, you know, it was even surprising to us, to be honest. So yeah, tell us about the framework. Break it down for us. Yeah. So without advertising, it\\'s very straightforward. So one of the things I noticed Jon, and you\\'ll appreciate this cuz you know, you\\'re in a decision making role, right? You\\'re an executive, is that a lot of times, you know, when you come to need and reporting, people tend to focus on two things, right? They focus on the data and they focus on the medium, the output, whether it\\'s the visualization or the report. What I tend to realize, and what I learned was, before you get to all that stuff of visual and data, you actually need to understand what the hell the person wants. And so what I did is I created a framework on three tenants, which is the first one is what you ask. So when you\\'re working with someone, what are the exact type of questions you need to ask and not ask?Then it\\'s what you write. So the second part is about actually how to storyboard and we\\'ve created our own storyboard, and then it\\'s what to, what to visualize or draw, right? So then it\\'s what, how do you express and communicate that? So we kind of went backwards, but that was again, just based on my experience consulting with Fortune 500 companies around the world. And that has been a hit. We\\'ve had multiple companies adopt it from Shell to Ericsson to Nestle, you name it, across the globe. They\\'ve brought it in. You know, a lot of time we get data leaders or BI leaders that will bring it in, adopt it, and it it works with any BI tool. So we\\'re tool agnostic.Jon Krohn:Oh, gotcha. So some people, I guess the big kind of tools in the BI space are Tableau, Power BI- ThoughtSpot. Correct. And so with us, it doesn\\'t matter, right? I mean, the reality is that, and you notice this, Jon, all these tools have a bar chart right? Now, you know, one of them may take two clicks to get a bar chart, another one may take three clicks, but you know, they all have a bar chart. And so we stayed away from the tool and we focus on a framework and whatever output you have, you can actually build in any tool that you want. Because you notice the tool, the tool, this is like the Fortune 500, right? It comes and goes, I mean, in the next three years it\\'s all going to change again, right? Today it was Tableau, first it was Business Objects, then Tableau, now it\\'s Power BI. Two to three years from now, it\\'ll be, you name it, you know. So we, it was very smart for us [inaudible] tool because I think tools come and go, but you got to have the foundational knowledge. Nice. Do you have from your perspective there, do you have any insights for us on what the next tool might be? Yeah. So I have some thoughts. I get asked. That\\'s actually the number one question I get asked. Oh, really? Ah, I was like, ah, I\\'ve got such a smart question. I bt no one thinks so much. No, but I used to never answer it across the world. Like it\\'s literally, I\\'d be in these keynotes, I\\'d be at these like customer events, like at the vendor event, and they\\'re like, Mico, what tool do you prefer? I\\'m like, oh, f***. I\\'m like, well, it\\'s not the tool of the vendor I\\'m speaking at. So, right? So I was like, I refuse, I plead the fifth. But I don\\'t know, you know, I have some hope for ThoughtSpot, I think they\\'re doing some super cool stuff. They\\'re kind of ahead in NLP and, and kind of how they approach it. There\\'s some contenders up and common. You know, there\\'s this Headless BI concept now. Companies like GoodData. My good friend Ryan Dolley works there. So there\\'s some stuff, but I don\\'t know, I think Power BI is going to be the king of the land or queen for at least another three to four years solid. I just don\\'t see anybody that\\'s close enough. And I think Tableau\\'s going a different direction. So if anybody may be ThoughtSpot, maybe, maybe a GoodData. So I have a few questions coming out of this. So first of all, what, what is Headless BI? What does that mean?Mico Yuk:Okay, so I know you\\'ve heard about Reverse ETL, right?Jon Krohn:Yeah, yeah, yeah. But maybe you can break it down for our listeners. Okay. Well, I am no specialist in Reverse ETL, but I could tell you what it is, only because I know the two companies very well that do it, which is Hightouch or Census. I think you\\'ve heard of both of those. So essentially Reverse ETL, what ETL used to be was you would have to take the data and get it into one place, right? And then when you get into one place, you would do all this stuff there and then you could use it. Reverse ETL is the opposite. Reverse ETL is, you know what, we\\'re not taking the data in one place. We\\'re going to put everything, we\\'re going to take all the data sources and let you kind of pull from them, pull it together, pull from them as needed and do what you need to do. So essentially what it does is it kind of eliminates this kind of, you know, single source of truth I call, you know, I call, so I can go on a rant on this. I live through the data warehouse era. I hate to age myself, right? And I call it data warehouse era The Lord of the Ring. Why do I call it this, what I call it The Lord of the Rings? You remember the ring in Lord of the Rings? Yeah. It was the precious. That is what a data warehouse is. Yeah. Do you remember how he went down the dark tunnel to try to get it ? He never came. I see, I see. You get it. Right? So I would look through the data warehouse everywhere. Everybody wanted a single story to the thruth. And so it\\'s kind of funny today to see that they\\'re like, you know what? The hell with that. Stop, stop. You no longer want that. Just give us our data. And so I think out of that, it has bred stuff like Reverse ETL and \"Headless BI\", right? So a company like GoodData, and it\\'s, I hope I get it right. Ryan explained it to me. They\\'re not focused on having a encompassing, like a Power BI BI tool where they then hold your data and then you have the visual end, right? They\\'re focused on allowing you to take the data and you can actually connect it to any tool that you want, right? So it\\'s a Headless BI, it doesn\\'t have its own \"face\" like a Power BI or Tableau. Does that make sense?Jon Krohn:Gotcha. Gotcha, gotcha. So it\\'s kind of more like an API than a UI. That\\'s exactly correct. And don\\'t get me wrong, they do have a visualization element or element to report on, but you don\\'t have to use it. So they allow people with all these different data sources to kind of be a bit more free, I guess, heterogeneous in terms of their approach in how they want to visualize, right? I think, I think it\\'s a result of the field data leaks. It\\'s a different discussion, it\\'s a result of the data leaks that everybody wanted like five years ago to fail. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. So now we\\'re headless, we\\'re like Headless BI, so yeah. All right. Pretty animated there. All right. I\\'m going on a runt. Going back, you mentioned the Power BI you think is going to be queen for a while. So what is about Power BI that makes it the default choice today? So it\\'s not a great tool. Okay. Power BI is not a great tool. I just, and forgive me, Lord, I have so many friends at Microsoft- That must be the first Microsoft tool that people don\\'t like. Right? No. Yeah. Okay. No- I don\\'t have any, I\\'m like, if people haven\\'t figured this out from the show for, I don\\'t have any Microsoft software anywhere. Okay. I\\'m an Apple girl, so I think I have Microsoft on my desktop, granted, but the licensing is always an issue cuz they can never get it right. But anyways, so Power BI is not a great tool. The power of Power BI is the fact that you get everything that comes with it, like Azure, right? So I think what they have done though is that they\\'ve allowed Power BI to show up in Office 365 where anybody can download it, but it\\'s a visualization tool coming from like a sophisticated tool like Business Office of Tableau, like I did. Power BI is like chop change, baby change. So, you know, I love Microsoft, oh God, let me help you, Microsoft people I love you. I was a Microsoft RD and a [inaudible] I need need to put this out there. I love you. They do amazing research. They actually, they publish more than any of the other big tech companies.Mico Yuk:Well, I call them the Mercedes-Benz of our industry, right? Mercedes-Benz has more patents than anybody else, so I consider them to be, but what is good about Power BI is Microsoft. Microsoft\\'s innovation cycle and the way that they\\'re innovating. That\\'s why I would get Power BI, not because the tool is great, because they are not stopping, you know, you could see how quickly they jumped into OpenAI. I mean, they were on it before the thing got hot, you know? So I think with Power BI what you see is people see that Microsoft is leading as a company and they realize, hey, this tool one isn\\'t going to disappear and it\\'s going to continue to evolve.Jon Krohn:Gotcha. So it\\'s the queen because Microsoft evolves so quickly, they- Innovation. Integrate things so quickly and it also gives you great connectivity with Azure. Yeah. Like take an example, the Python thing, Microsoft bought R, the Power BI team saw Python was running. Yeah. They bought, they bought R. They bought R? I believe so, yeah. Yeah. I think they, I think they, they bought R, they did a stake in it. They identified that Python was, Python was hot. And even though R was a big investment, they just, they just opened the door to Python. You know, they, they are, they\\'re very forward thinking. Oh, yeah, I see. Yeah. So Microsoft hired Revolution Analytics- Correct. In 2015. And yeah, Revolution was a commercial provider of R software. Yeah, yeah, yeah.Mico Yuk:Correct. Right. And so think about that. They made this big investment and because they thought that was the way forward, again, they were ahead of their time, saw Python pick up, and I was there when, you know, when that decision was made and they said, you know what, investment or not, we\\'re opening the door to Python. And so Power BI fully works at Python. And so, you know, that level of thinking where you\\'re willing to be heterogeneous and even cannibalize your own products, that\\'s the company that\\'s going to thrive.Jon Krohn:I guess with how big they are, they\\'re going to have to be cannibalizing.Mico Yuk:Correct. Butchering the process. Cannibalizing, Cannibalizing, they\\'re going to have to cannibalize something. Because they\\'re, they\\'ve got tentacles in everything. In everything, correct. Yeah. So I just think Microsoft is a winning, they\\'re winning all around and I don\\'t, I don\\'t see that stopping anytime soon. I mean, you know, you have Salesforce, you have Google with Looker, you know, at one point I thought Looker was going to be up there, Google acquired them. You have Tableau, Salesforce acquired them. I mean, what, what do we really have left? You know, I don\\'t know if ThoughtSpot is going to get acquired, you know, micro strategy has been hanging around. No one will buy it because of the f*** up CEO. So yeah, it\\'s, you know, it\\'s, is this, should I not say that on this podcast? Sorry. No, I\\'m glad that, it\\'s awesome to have you be so open about, yeah, I try to, I guess I\\'m too diplomatic maybe too much of the time. I should take, I should take a note out of your book. I love it. Oh, you didn\\'t see my last post telling people \"Sionara [inaudible]\"? Oh yeah. I\\'ll have to say that went viral. You didn\\'t see it? Yeah. I posted something controversial and I lost like 150 followers, like within hours. And they were all like, the top viewers were CEOs, founders, directors, executives, and I said, \"Sionara [inaudible]\" And it went viral.Jon Krohn:Oh my goodness. That\\'s wow. I mean, after the pandemic, like life is, you know, it just, it\\'s got to be me. Well it\\'s great to have that on this show. Thank you. Mico. Yeah, so f*** up CEO, Michael, I mean he, Michael Saylor, like he\\'s all Bitcoin also, you know, it\\'s, if you want to do Bitcoin, you can invest in market strategy. Okay. Yeah. I mean, so this is all news to me. But okay, so we\\'ve talked about the frameworks or sorry, we\\'ve talked about these different BI tools and got your great insights on them. I actually dragged you over here on a tangent. What we were talking about was your state, your BIDS framework- Yes. The BI and analytics data storytelling framework. And so you were telling us about it, you were saying that you break things up into three categories of questions. And so there was what kinds of questions to ask, and then there\\'s how do you visually communicate? And I didn\\'t catch what the third one was.Mico Yuk:And it\\'s what do you write? So we go from asking questions, taking the answers, and put them in the storyboard. So that\\'s the written part. And then we take that and we visualize and communicate it. Because what I found, what I found in, you\\'re in New York, right, Jon? Yep. Okay. So you\\'re known in New York crowd. It\\'s a tough crowd. Like it\\'s, I started my career in New York and I got my [inaudible] handed to me every day. It was like clockwork. I got, I went to work, got my [inaudible] handed to me, went back home, looked at it, cried, went back to work, got it, handed it to me again. Right? And so and so what I learned, what I quickly learned in New York taught me that lesson was that I was asking the wrong questions. So I would open my mouth and it would be like freaking like again, Lord of the Rings, like it would just like open the door to all these crazy responses that I couldn\\'t control. And so what I learned was I break the framework down into specific questions that you ask to get the right answers. So that, that was, that was a big starting point of how you actually get the conversation under control. Nice. So I mentioned how you are, or you were a co-founder. I guess you, I guess you\\'re a co-founder, somebody\\'s co-founder forever. It\\'s present tense. You are a co-founder of the BI experience group that does the education around this framework and that has all these students and seven figure eight- They\\'re amazing. But that no longer is your focus. And actually your most recent role was at Count as their chief data evangelist, but you\\'re also, you\\'ve stepped back from that for the most part. You\\'re just doing a little bit of advisory. Did it to a year. Now. Yeah- Correct. Yeah. And so now you\\'re looking for your next big thing, at least at the time of recording. Yes. And so, yeah, tell us about that search. I know from a post that you recently made, I\\'m going to include a link to this post in the show notes. But you mentioned how when you scroll through your newsfeed and you see who\\'s being affected by layoffs, seems to be disproportionately affecting some groups. Correct. Yeah. So this is, again, not to me like, so just so we\\'re clear Count is amazing. I was not treated in any way discriminatory. I need to put that out there because some people wrote me, I said, what did Count do you? I\\'m like, Count did nothing. My, our CEO is amazing. I was treated amazingly, but this is just my observation and I\\'ve been watching it now for months. So if you go to tech layoffs, anytime you see tech like Shopify layoffs or another product, any company, just any of them just roll down. And what you mostly see is either women, older people, or just minorities as a whole. Okay. And so I I, I\\'ve been tracking this and I kind of started, I looked at it and I said, well, you know what, this is not conclusive, right? I was a data scientist, so I\\'m like, you can\\'t just look at a LinkedIn.Maybe women are more expressive, you know, and maybe they just go online and post. So I decided to start to speak to people and unfortunately behind the scenes, I had gentlemen, white males confirming to me that, Hey, something does look a little stinky, you know, in multiple companies. And I said, well, you know, like, what, what\\'s going on? And they said, well, there\\'s so much happening. It like, it\\'s happening so fast you only could see it after the fact. But I did actually go back in and confirm through a few companies with no names Paul, that like, you know, some people are watching this going, Hey, this, this is a little stinky. Like why do we get rid of the women on maternity and why we get rid of all, you know what I mean? So there is some discrimination going, you know, I had multiple women tell me, yeah, I am, you know, 35 or 38 or 45 and all that\\'s left is a 20 year old women.I had, I\\'ve heard that multiple times, you know, or I had gentlemen tell me that. They\\'re like, yeah, I have all this experience. You know, and all that\\'s left is one set of age belief as a good example. So I, I, again, not conclusive until you have the data. I was a data scientist, so I\\'m sensitive to that. I understand that. But it\\'s very visual and it tells a lot. And so, you know, there\\'s definitely something happening and I think my biggest fear is that we\\'re, you know, three, four years from now going to look exactly how we looked before, like we\\'re reversing, you know? And so it\\'s just a big fear. But I went viral. Yeah. I just, I just put it out there cuz I was trying to call out to say, Hey, if you\\'re reading this, and then I got a bunch of private dms of gentlemen telling me, you know, hey Mico, what you do matters. And you know, thank you for pointing this out. Clearly you don\\'t want to be public, but you know, they, they\\'re like, what you do matters. You should just know that what you do matters. Don\\'t lose your voice. What you do matters. So I know that if it saved one minority in any category, whether it\\'s gender, ethnicity, race, or age, it was worth the word, the loss of followers. You know? Yeah. I am aware of at least one big tech company that in layoffs was I think there\\'s a lot of constraints against letting people go when they\\'re in maternity leave. Right. But so something that they were doing was people who had been approved for maternity to leave, say to start next week. That\\'s correct. And that\\'s wild. And it, and it just sabotages like somebody took the list and just sabotage it. But no, I spoke to women that were at home with their babies on leave and got the ax. I mean, just [inaudible] got the ax. Like they were scheduled to come back to work next week or da da da and they just, they just told them, don\\'t bother to come back. You know? So, you know, don\\'t get me wrong. Like I, I\\'m not saying again without conclusive data, we\\'re data people. We got to be careful that it\\'s, maybe it\\'s only visible the people who type of people who post, but it, it, you know, talking to people, I got a good perspective that yeah, it, there\\'s, there\\'s some smelly stuff going, you know, that, that supposedly it\\'s random but it just keeps all looking the same. Yeah. Well, so there\\'s a good project out there maybe for a listener where something that I\\'m sure I\\'ve said on air before is that, you know, if you\\'re looking for maybe your first data analytics job or your first data science job, having your own portfolio of research on some, independently on some project that you independently conceived of. So good. So this could potentially be one where- Agreed. Look into this problem and see whether this is in fact you know, something that you can, that bears out in the data and yeah. If that is the case, then please tag Mico and me in a post about that. Yeah. So anyway, so that was just something that I saw again, not hopefully not necessarily affecting me though I did have an interesting experience. Yeah, I\\'m out there looking for my next opportunity. I am interested in helping to build communities. I\\'m very, I\\'m very gunned up by how big DBT got on Slack, you know, that was very exciting for me. So I\\'m pretty excited, you know, not the developer advocate cuz I\\'m not as technical anymore, but anything at like drives community, events, engagement, that\\'s kind of where my sweet spot is. I\\'m a community like you a media person, community person. Right?Jon Krohn:Well no doubt- [crosstalk]. Yeah. You\\'re going to find an amazing cult to lead next alongside the cult that you continue to lead the AOF fam analytics inspired fam cult. After I just defamed like five companies on the podcast. But yeah, that\\'s fine. I mean- Yeah. It\\'s not going to be every company. So Mico, this has been a really fun episode of course. And we\\'ve also learned some great perspective on the BI and analytics landscape. So before I let my guests go, I always ask them for a book recommendation. Yeah. So this is definitely not your typical data book. There\\'s actually two books that I like. The first one is The Richest Man in Babylon. It\\'s by George Clason. It is epic. I heard it first by, it was recommended by Noah Kagan from AppSumo, I\\'m assuming you\\'re familiar with AppSumo. And he recommended it. And so I took it and I did the audio version, which, you know, audiobooks always weird, depend on the narrator. It\\'s such a good book. It\\'s kind of like Slumdog Millionaire style, but the lessons that are learned are amazing. And if people like that book, one of my other favorite books I\\'m reading right now is The Psychology of Money. Those are both like epic books. Psychology of Mind? Of Money. Of Money. It\\'s epic. Yeah. So those are both, you know, and, and so much more not money, obviously I know they both talk about wealth, but the way in the style the books are written, it\\'s so much more deeper than, you know, just financials, right? It\\'s just overall mindset because, you know, financial wealth is a journey, right? It\\'s not a, it\\'s not a marathon, it\\'s no silver bullet. So those are two books I\\'d recommend. Nice. Very cool. Great practical and economical tips for our audience there. Thank you Mico. All right, so I imagine there are lots of listeners out there who want to be able to follow you after this episode and get more real talk. Except the vendors. What\\'s good, what\\'s bad? No punches held back. So obviously your Analytics on Fire podcast is a way for them to go. How else can they follow you? Yeah, so most people follow me on LinkedIn. It\\'s pretty easy. Micko, Yuk, M I C O Y U K. And then recently I opened up my Instagram account. I\\'ll be doing more on there. So feel free to follow me. And as you know, I\\'m getting ready to start my YouTube channel, so any of those channels will be great. As of today. I do a lot on Instagram. On LinkedIn, but you took [inaudible] Nice. We\\'ll be sure to include links to all of those in the show notes. Mico, thank you for finally being on the show. It has been an absolute hoot to have you on and hopefully it won\\'t be too long before we can get you on again. Yay. All right, well hopefully, hopefully you don\\'t have any sponsors that get pissed off, but yeah, I\\'ll be happy to come back. Thank you so much, Jon. Thanks Mico. What a switched-on person Mico is about the analytics industry. In today\\'s episode, she covered her BIDS, BI data storytelling framework for persuading decision makers. She talked about how Microsoft Power BI is the queen of analytics today while ThoughtSpot could be the heiress. And she filled us in on how Headless BI tools like GoodData allow for Reverse ETL that\\'s extract, transform, and load operations. All right, that\\'s it for today\\'s episode. Until next time, keep on rocking it out there folks and I\\'m looking forward to enjoying another round of the SuperDataScience Podcast with you very soon.'\n",
    "#doc = 'Welcome to the SuperDataScience show. For this special 500th episode, we\\'re going to enjoy a mind-expanding Yoga Nidra session led by the wonderful Yogi, Jes Allen. Jes Allen, can\\'t believe you\\'re on the SuperDataScience podcast. It\\'s wonderful to have you here. I was thinking for a while, I was thinking for months when I noticed that episode 500 was coming up, and what was months ago a distant future. And now it\\'s not that far away, episode 500 will be released very soon and we\\'re recording it right now. And so I was thinking to myself for months, I was like, \"What can I do that would be extra special for the audience for episode 500?\" And time and again, the idea that kept coming back to me was you offering a yoga Nidra practice. So now here you are. Yeah. Thank you. I\\'m so excited to be here. I\\'m so happy to be here. So I\\'ve known you for a long time. I started doing yoga practice, the poses of yoga in 2012, I was living in Singapore and once a week on Saturdays at this mixed martial arts gym, I was a part of, they had this yoga class. And I was sore a lot from all the mixed martial arts, And so I was like, \"I really need to stretch.\" So stretching, that\\'s what yoga is. And we\\'ll get into this, but yoga is a lot more than stretching, but that\\'s what I thought at the time. And so I went to the Saturday class and I remember the opening up of my body, literally, I mean, the physical postures are helpful for opening you up. I remember feeling amazing in a way that I couldn\\'t remember having felt later that Saturday, later that day. So I went back, started going back every Saturday. Left Singapore, moved to New York, and not long after that, I went to a yoga studio in Manhattan in NoHo and you were one of the teachers there. And I had a class with you that was incredible, completely beyond the quality of any yoga class I\\'d ever had before. And at the end of the class, you said, \"All right, well that was my\" ... I can\\'t remember what the classes were called.Jes Allen:They were really simple names, like strong, energize, relax. Right. It wouldn\\'t surprise you even with what I\\'ve just said, and certainly just the way you know me, but I was there for the strong classes, the strong yoga. So I would come for your strong class and then at the end of it, you\\'re like, \"At 10 minutes or something, I have another class starting, a relaxed class in the same studio.\" And I was like, \"Oh, alright.\" And I stayed for that. So it was like three hours or something of yoga with you just to kick things off. And now I\\'ve been following you around the world. So that was eight years ago. And I\\'ve gone on retreats with you to Mexico, to Greece and have been to classes at studios of yours, studios that you\\'ve taught at all over New York. So anyway, huge fan. And I know episode 500 is going to be amazing. So in episode 450, we had Steve Fazzari whom you\\'ve met once, he came to a yoga class of yours once. And Steve talked to us about the physiological benefits of yoga nidra, like improves sleep, for example, is one of the things that he talked about. And at the end of the episode, he did a quick five minute run through of kind of like the structure of a yoga nidra practice. And so for today\\'s episode, we\\'re going to do a full practice. But before we get to that, I\\'d like to talk a bit about what yoga means and what it means to be a yoga practitioner. So as I\\'ve now learned in the last decade, yoga is not just stretching, and yoga is not even just the physical postures. So what in yoga are called the asana, the physical postures, that\\'s part of it. But I mean, just tell us more generally what yoga is all about. Well, I have to comment on your language of stretching and opening, because even those two words, you are referring to them in your physical form, but it is still, they\\'re expansion words, they\\'re words that also mean to expand. And yoga, it means union or to yoke, but it\\'s to become unified consciously with the one consciousness, it\\'s to remember that we don\\'t have to come together because we\\'re not apart. We don\\'t have to unify, we are unified. And so we expand our awareness of consciousness through practice to remember that we are consciousness ourselves, that the essence of us and all things is pure consciousness. So as you stretch your body, you stretch your consciousness. As you open your body, you open your consciousness. You expand, you expand your awareness of yourself, of how you hold patterns, of what it feels like to be in a human form, of how you relate to emotions and programming. And as you become aware of yourself, you start to become aware of your interactions with everything. So even starting with the asana as a practice is incredibly expansive. And I think we all experience that in the beginning, we\\'re like, \"Wow. And I feel more connected to myself.\" And life starts opening up because I\\'m opening to myself, which is how we experience everything. And then at a certain point, our curiosity, if we feel called to continue to expand our consciousness, takes us into different states of practice. And I think ultimately, as starting also as a very strong yoga asana practitioner, and then in my journeys over the past decade, coming down to settling into a practice such as yoga nidra, which is laying on the ground doing nothing, there has been quite a journey. But this is where the expansion of consciousness and understanding that has taken me ... And I think it\\'s just important to note that we\\'re not expanding consciousness, just our awareness of consciousness. Consciousness is always expanding on its own. So these practices bring us into relationship with the natural expansion of life, as opposed to feeling like it\\'s something that we are separate from. A beautiful definition. So in this decade of practicing yoga, you started off teaching these kinds of athletic classes. There were meditative elements. It was through my early yoga practices, and particularly through your classes that I started to be present in the moment in the room, in my own mind for a few instance. And I remember thinking, being on a yoga mat, doing a yoga flow and being like, \"Oh wow, I\\'m here. I\\'ve got hands. My hands are on the mat, there they are.\" And not being caught up in the next thing that I need to do or things that I\\'d done that day that I could have done better. And so anyway, so you started with the physical, teaching the physical asana practice about a decade ago, and that has now transformed, as you\\'re saying, to include things like yoga nidra. And so yoga, it can be a big umbrella term to capture the physical postures like asana, nidra, like you said laying down, and surely not doing nothing, but not moving. You can think of it as like a philosophy of life. There\\'s teachings, there\\'s literature that you can read. I have experienced that. I\\'ve been to your apartment in Brooklyn and studied the Upanishads which are Hindu scripture and studying those week after week with a group of people. And there are books like that, the Bhagavad Gita is a popular one in yoga. And so there\\'s these books that you can use to learn about yoga as a way of life, as opposed to just postures. But what I\\'m specifically getting to is today, what do you offer as a yoga practitioner? So we\\'re going to talk about yoga nidra a lot. So that\\'s obviously something that you offer and we\\'re going to experience on this podcast. You also have weekly online asana physical practice. I know you still do retreats. There\\'s one coming up in Greece in September. And it sounds like I\\'ve also heard you recently been getting into coaching. So maybe tell us about all of those things. Sure, yeah. So I guess I am an intuitive being and we all are intuitive beings. And I\\'ve always related to myself as an artist first growing up, this was really what it was for me. So my path with yoga and practices have been really circular and I\\'m a curious being. So I actually was a gymnast growing up and I took my first yoga class when I was 17. And it was a little slow for me at the time, but I remembered understanding it because of the postures and creating sequences and having body awareness that I learned. And I understood it to be a self-discipline even at that age. And there was something magical that clicked for me in the opening of awareness. And like many of us at that age, I was in a pretty nodded relationship with myself. And I did my first teacher training when I was 21. And the most amazing thing for me in that training was learning about the chakra system and the energetic systems of our bodies, because this is how I really was. I was looking for the magic, right? I didn\\'t want the answer in a scientific way. I wanted to understand life the way I was understanding and receiving it, which was through feeling and awe and magic and alignment synchronicity. So I had a rough start in my healing, my early 20 healing years. And when I finally really came back to yoga, it started with the asana, and it was so important for me at the time because it gave me confidence to change my life. It showed me that I could learn things and build strength and figure out tricky asanas. And it empowered me to go, \"I can change my life. I can figure these things out.\" And that was really important to me then. And since then, basically I started practicing and teaching at the same time, in that way. I had been practicing for a while, when I came back to it, I was like, \"This is what I have to do. I have to teach.\" And so my practices in my teachings have gone like this. So as I have ... One in front of the other, like little steps, like a little track. And so I would have an opening in myself and feel called towards something. And then once I would feel like it was embodied in my being, I would want to give it back. And so one of my favorite things to do, and what I started doing early in my teaching was cultivating my own classes at different venues in New York, in the early days in Brooklyn. And then I started leading retreats. So retreats have been just the most magical experiences for me to create over the past five years. I\\'ve led, I think, 17 retreats in that time. And it\\'s just the most amazing thing to bring. As you have felt a couple of times, a group of human beings together in a particular place, for a particular amount of time and just really dive in and like magic is super available. So that is a forever passion of mine and I\\'ll always be offering those. It\\'s tricky in the world right now, but we are going to Greece in a month. And I\\'m working on Bali or Morocco over the winter. So that\\'s happening. Just talk quickly about the retreat experience. I don\\'t know, I\\'ve only done yoga retreats with you, so I might not have a really good understanding of what they\\'re like. But I might have thought prior to going on them with you that a yoga retreat was this kind of intensive physical practice. And of course, I expect the same kinds of like you\\'re saying, as I open myself physically, I\\'ll open mine and I\\'ll have this amazing positive experience, getting just a good break away from the world and do lots of yoga with cool people and talk to them. But, the way that you structure your retreats, and it sounds to me like the way you increasingly structured them is so that yes, there is a physical practice. So probably twice a day. So there\\'s like a morning practice and evening practice on most days, but there\\'s tons of other deliberate practice of journaling, of answering tough questions together in a structured way, of getting to know what people are like in a structured way and what your own mind is like and what you are like and what you want and what you could be doing and what you could do in the future. And, yeah. I mean, I guess I\\'m trying to make a case for yoga retreats in general, and yoga retreats in particular with you. But if you want to get away from the regular patterns that you\\'re in, in the other 50 weeks of the year and spend a week or two of your year, just taking a step back and thinking about, \"What am I doing?\" Well, that\\'s what retreat means, right? It means to step back. It means to withdraw yourself from a moment. And I know that you meditate every day. And one aspect of meditation is just in the beginning, to just become a witness to your mind and to your life. And we don\\'t give ourselves enough time to really see how we\\'re living and see how we\\'re seeing. And so when we intentionally remove ourselves, we can go on vacation and that can feed us in a million ways. And when you retreat, you drawback consciously and engage in inner practices, things I\\'m doing now are like asana in the morning, meditation, yoga nidra, again, sound, cacao ceremony, silence. All different kinds of workshops to awaken you. And this really has been my path with practice is finding all these different things to serve as mirrors to who we are. I have told myself that I\\'m on a path of many mirrors because this is so exciting to me to go in. I started with asana and at a certain point ... And then the energetic systems. And then I moved into chigong, and I moved into meditation, and I moved into cacao and journaling and different aspects of meditation and yoga nidra and more. But each of these little things showed me a different perspective of myself, a different piece, a different way to see myself, a different way to experience myself. And this helps us see the world in that many ways. If I can see myself in this many ways, I can only access in another being as much as I\\'ve access of myself. I can only access in life as much as I have accessed in me. So the more I understand how diverse and expansive I am, the more diverse and expansive my life can be. And something I want to just highlight is that when we talk about yoga and we talk about expanding consciousness or expanding our awareness of consciousness, it\\'s like, \"What\\'s the point? What\\'s the point in all of this?\" There\\'s like a lot of big, fancy words and that\\'s cool to be spiritual and everything, and like, \"Yeah. I\\'m one, and [inaudible] conceptually.\" But what is the point? What\\'s the point in doing practice? What\\'s the point in showing up every single day? And then we get into this big word, which is healing. Healing is the point. We are wanting ... I think all of us are wanting to live a life of less suffering. And we are part of a collective evolution that is at the pace that it is at. And the first thing we do is heal ourselves. As we heal ourselves, we create a ripple in consciousness that continues to stimulate awakenings all over the place. And that\\'s how the one organism of humanity wakes up. But even just for us on an individual level, if I can observe my life without so much attachment to outcomes, expectations, stories of the past, things that I want, things that I\\'m not okay with, if I\\'m able to loosen my grip, can I live with more grace? Can I feel more joy? Can I feel more gratitude? Can I allow things that are uncomfortable for me to come through my field and move out without completely destroying my day or longer than that? And so these practices are really like, can you associate yourself? Can you learn to relate to the part of you that is unchanging? The conscious witness that we all are, can you relate to that? Enough that the fluctuations of life and the mind no longer with you around like a ship out in a storm. And when we can do that, we just naturally become more loving and more compassionate and more understanding of the fluctuations of everything around us. So if I can show up and say, \"I\\'m working myself towards understanding the one consciousness and surrendering over to an evolutionary current that I am not in control of, but I am a witness to. Well, now, I\\'m so free.\" I\\'m so free to step into life and be forgiving of everything that I can\\'t control and return to what are the universal truths? My teacher Yogarupa Rod Stryker, who I received my yoga nidra training with that I resonate with the most, he says, \"If it\\'s not true for everyone, it\\'s not true.\" And this is something I come back to, if it\\'s not true for everyone, it\\'s not true. And that\\'s not to say your experience isn\\'t valid, your feelings aren\\'t valid, all of them are true and valid, but what is the ultimate truth? And can I remember that peace in myself so that I\\'m not only just Allen who lived in Brooklyn for 12 years and just moved upstate and used to teach there, and now does this, right? I\\'m not only those things. Which is challenging and confusing to be my emotions, my actions, my relationships, that\\'s hard. So I\\'m not only that. All right. So obviously your retreats sound amazing. Yoga retreats in general sound amazing and can be hugely fruitful, but not everyone, especially in a pandemic can get up and fly to Greece. So how are ways that people can engage with you to get mentorship in some other way? Yeah. Well, one thing that the pandemic has definitely opened up, it has been the online platform. And I started a Patreon account really as like a response to all of the yoga studios getting shut down about a year and a half ago. And it\\'s been such an amazing opportunity to share content. And so I\\'ve got that platform that has tons of asana practices, yoga nidras, meditations, some workshops, and I get on and do lectures every once in a while. And what that has really opened for me is this understanding of empowering the practitioner at home so that we aren\\'t actually relying on going to a yoga studio every single day, or even going on retreats which is something that you might only be able to do once a year, if that anyway. And what has become very apparent to me is that what we need is more practitioners as opposed to teachers. There\\'s a lot of teacher training programs out there, and that\\'s great. And also you spend a good amount of time learning how to teach in a teacher training, which might not necessarily be what you want to do. And I believe that we need to all be in practice. This is how we are waking up to ourselves and to our life. And so I have recently started mentorship for practitioners. So I\\'ve been doing mentorship for teachers for many years, newer teachers, teachers who want to go deeper, and that is really amazing. And I love to get into that work from that teacher mindset. And I\\'ve started in the past few months doing mentorship for practitioners. So basically that looks like us meeting and dissecting, like, \"Let\\'s look at what\\'s happening in life right now. Let\\'s look at what you\\'re feeling on creating, expanding, opening within yourself.\" And then the past really like decade or more than that, of me being super living and practice, living and practice. And navigating my life through practice, I\\'m able to help you build a practice for yourself. And navigate where you want to go and give you the tools so that you feel empowered to be able to take these tools into your own life, even when I\\'m not around. And that\\'s really the goal is to empower your own intuition and feel like you have enough tools and enough knowledge that you can care for yourself and that you have antidotes and medicine in your life to come to every day. And this has been an amazingly rewarding practice for myself to offer in this kind of way and see people start to blossom and just get so excited about practice and empower and empower them to take control in their own life and on a regular basis. I don\\'t go a day without practicing. I can\\'t imagine what that would be like, however, it doesn\\'t look the same every day. And that\\'s important to know too. That sounds really cool. And so a yoga practitioner can be anyone, right? So a yoga teacher, we kind of think of that as like, \"Okay, maybe you need\" ... I mean, you don\\'t actually, but you kind of think of it as needing a formal qualification and then being qualified, stand in front of a room and talk to people. Being a yoga practitioner means just practicing the teachings of yoga and experiencing more connection with everything around you. Absolutely. And this is the key to us. We\\'re not all going to be yoga teachers. We\\'re not all going to be meditation teachers and spiritual teachers, but we are all beings of yoga or beings of spirituality. And we can be that. Beautifully said Jes, and I\\'m looking forward to reviewing the recording and experiencing everything you just said there again, because that was awesome. I guess we should get into the yoga nidra practice. I mean, I think we\\'ve teed it up really well now. So we had a bit of an introduction to yoga nidra in episode 450 with Steve, but you teach yoga nidra from a different lineage. So I think we might as well just hear it fresh from you. So what is yoga nidra? What are we about to experience? Yeah. So actually, the lineage that I am teaching in is the Shri Vidya tradition, my teacher is Yogarupa Rod Stryker. These practices and the interpretation of yoga nidra, the way that he has received them from his teacher and were passed to me are from the Mandukya Upanishad. So straight from the upanishadic literature, which speaks to the four states of consciousness and the actual technique of yoga nidra, and yoga nidra of being both a practice and a state. So when you say yoga, yoga is not just a practice, there are yoga practices, but yoga is a state of being, it\\'s the state of being connected consciously. Nidra means sleep, which Steve probably spoke too. And so yoga nidra means sleep with yoga or sleep of consciousness. So it\\'s to come into a state where you\\'ve rested your entire body, mind, all of that is asleep, but consciousness is still there. Consciousness still exists. So the way I have also been passed information in this lineage is through having a handful of different intentions for the practice. One of those being healing and general healing, which is what Steve really spoke to in the physiological healing of the body, the nervous system, getting immense amount of rest, which is so, so, so, so, so important. Another intention that we\\'ll be diving into today in the practice is a cognitive practice, which allows us to associate ourselves with the witness consciousness and then observe the way our mind is producing thought and what is retaining through our days, through our life. And if those things are beneficial to us or not. And then if we want to continue to explore how to work with our awareness to perhaps bring more grace into your life. There is also a transformative practice, which we can take things that are triggering or activating, or that we\\'re having challenges with in our life and bring them into this soft state of yoga nidra and activate them in our being. And then ask for resolution or healing imagery not necessarily mental-based conversational solutions, but felt energetic healing for these things to bring ourselves into a state of peace and to be able to work with them with more grace. There\\'s also the practice of sankalpa, which Steve may have spoke to also. This is a practice of creating a resolve for yourself that is like an intention that is almost something bigger than you think that you can do on your own. So you call for divine intervention. Yeah. So it should be a really big intention, something around eight to 12, eight to 18 months even. A goal this big, right? Nothing that you\\'re like, \"I can do that next month.\" At least a year your calling in this prayer. And then the primary intention and at the basis of all of this is spiritual awakening or becoming unified with consciousness and resting in that one consciousness. So there are several different kinds of techniques to work within these spaces. And they\\'re almost a progression. Not that one is better than the other, but that we have to first heal our bodies, understand our minds, transform our perspectives, create goals from a pure place, create fulfilling lives for ourselves from that awareness, and then be able to rest back enough to awaken into the magic of truth. So the way I use these techniques is they\\'re all over the place. They\\'re not this linear progression that our mind wants to grip onto because we have that past, future ladder mentality, but everything is circular. So they work together. And part of practice is knowing when one can come in and [inaudible] when they shift. It\\'s very deep. It\\'s extensive. One thing I do want to share that was one of the greatest insights I have received through this work is that when you set up the conditions for healing, healing happens on its own. And we\\'re really attached to us being the doer and us changing ourselves, whether that\\'s through physical change, we feel like we have to ... I\\'m using my hands here because we feel like we have to grip and change and mutate, and that is only our will that creates change in our life. But that\\'s not true. We do have to be an active participant, but our soul calls us into alignment and it\\'s just our job to walk towards our own soul, our own vision. And healing is really the natural state. So we talk about this as like a remembering of who we are. We\\'re not learning something new, we\\'re just uncovering the truth. And so when you lay yourself down and you come into a space of unity, you remember. And that healing starts to happen on its own because as your body, not even your mind, but as your body and your cells, your nervous system start to remember that you are safe, you are loved, you are held by this earth that you came from her, that we are connected to one source. All of these other fears and anxieties, they start to dissipate. The more that we remember our truth, the more we see the illusions of these fears. And so we can work into the healing through coming into love, coming into love, coming into love instead of how do I get through this pain? How do I get through this pain? How do I get to this pain? So the yoga nidra practice that we are going to be diving into in this episode is the cognitive practice that I spoke to in which we will use entering the state of yoga nidra as a foundation for us to bring awareness to our mind, our days, how we are seeing, what we are remembering. And get a better perspective, even an eagle-view of our life. So for this practice, you will want to be laying down and be comfortable. Being comfortable is one of the most important things in this practice. But we\\'ll give you a moment just to set up, you could lay down on the floor with a blanket underneath you and a pillow underneath your head. You could lay on a couch, you could lay in your bed. It doesn\\'t matter as long as you\\'re comfortable. It is recommended, although not necessary, if you\\'re in a very light-filled room to cover your eyes with a light piece of fabric. And if you\\'re cold at all, to place a blanket over knee, over your chest or over your legs. If you are placing a blanket over you, it\\'s recommended that the fingertips are exposed. So you can just let your hands slip out the sides, or even create little tents underneath the blanket with your hands so that the fingertips are sensitive and aware of space around them without weight. So just making your final adjustments here, and perhaps even fidgeting a little bit in the body. If there\\'s excess energy, you could squeeze your hands and squeeze your feet just for a moment and then exhale and let them go so you can feel that release. And then you\\'ll just want to commit in this moment to being still throughout the duration of the practice. If you feel the urge to move or adjust now, just do it so that you can say, \"Okay, now I\\'m comfortable enough to be here for the next 15 minutes.\" Just notice your breath. Now allow your body to open to the earth. The back body to become sensitive to the draw of gravity. Perhaps even feeling how deeply held you are. And then that feeling of being held, give your body any amount more over the rest. Become aware of yourself in the space. There is a floor or a piece of furniture underneath you, walls around you, sealing above you, and you are occupying this space, and this space is holding you. Just becoming aware of any sound, allowing your consciousness or your awareness to just travel to one sound and the next not lingering too long on any sound. Rather just tuning yourself to the textures of this space. Bringing your awareness to your breath and specifically down to your belly, and just gently beginning to shape diaphragmatic breathing. So on purpose, breathe into the belly and breathe out of the belly. So the chest here is more or less still, and you\\'re directing the breath down into the diaphragm. We\\'ll breathe like this for about a minute, consciously shaping the breath. I think two more breaths. After that second exhale, just allow the breath to return to a natural state, just simply observe the breath flowing. You\\'ll make an intention for yourself here to stay aware throughout the practice. So there\\'s a good chance that the body will sleep and a small chance that the mind could even sleep. But our intention is for awareness to remain, so just say to yourself three times mentally, \"I will stay aware throughout the practice.\" Now please bring your awareness to the third eye center or the space right in between your eyebrows. And notice as you do this, a gentle energy emerges. It might feel like a soft light, but there is a presence here. And just notice that presence that is already existing, but it awakens through your awareness. And then bring your awareness to your throat center and notice that same light or energy emerging with your awareness in the throat. Right shoulder joint, a light or awareness comes from inside the body. Right elbow, same light or presence. Right wrist, light inside the body, energy from within. Right thumb, pointer finger, middle finger, ring finger, pinky finger, all emerging light. Again in the right wrist, presence of consciousness. Right elbow, right shoulder joint, same light or presence emerging from within. Again in the throat center, feel that light. Left shoulder joint, again, a presence emerging from within the body, creating softness. Left elbow, inner presence. Left wrist, light emerging. The left thumb, pointer finger, middle finger, ring finger, pinky finger, full energy and light. Left wrist, presence from within. Left elbow, left shoulder, inner light. Throat center, awareness. Now in the heart center, feel an energy, a light presence emerge with your awareness of the space of the heart. Same awareness over to the right side of the chest. Back to the heart center. Awareness now in the left side of the chest. And heart center, feeling that light. Awareness, again, in the throat center. And landing the consciousness in the third eye center, the space right in between the eyebrows, and just allowing the consciousness to remain. Notice here that the consciousness bears witness to these energy points, and observe as you allow all of these points of energy or light to illuminate at the same time from within. Watching the brightening of these lights. Allowing that energy to keep the body soft, bringing your awareness back to the dark space behind the brows, behind the forehead, the dark screen of your mind. And beginning 30 minutes ago, recall on that screen what you are doing. And then begin to trace back your entire day until this moment in 30 minute intervals. Just allowing yourself to pass over interactions, actions, thought, feeling, right until you woke up this morning. A few minutes to do this. (silence) As you approach the morning, can you see yourself in bed right before you woke up, and recall any dreams from the night, encouraging the mind to continue to move in intervals through the evening of sleep. And then perhaps, becoming aware of the moment right before you fell asleep. Allow yourself now to release the hold of memory and draw back so that you may witness anything that was less than beneficial, or didn\\'t sit in the most pleasant resonance from even just this day. And just from the state of witness, gently assess, invite awareness to these areas of your life. With compassion and mere awareness, but awareness doesn\\'t judge, simply witnesses. Can you allow everything that you\\'ve drawn out of your mind to exist and bring yourself back to the witness consciousness or the place in you that sees. And arrest in this consciousness as self. Without moving the body at all, simply become aware of the breath in this state. And again, keeping the body very soft, bring your awareness back into the room, feeling yourself again, in this space, on the surface, contained. I\\'m taking just another moment to hold close to you anything that you\\'d like to carry with you outside of this practice, you could even plant that like a seed in your heart. And when it feels right for you, you could very gently move your fingers. Take a deeper breath in. I like to place my hands on my belly or my heart as the first movement to keep things gentle without jolting too much out of this sensitive space. I\\'m just feeling my palms and the breath meet each other. Whenever you are ready, knowing that you could just continue to lay right where you are, you could also shift to a side, come up to sit and eventually invite yourself back into your room, the waking part of your life. So welcome back from that exploration. Thank you. Thank you. I just want to note that, again, this is a practice that helps us to just bring more awareness into our life and it\\'s something that you could even do as a cognitive practice before you go to bed at night, like five minutes to retrace your day. And it improves memory in general, and it\\'s also just really good for maintaining awareness in our life and being able to assess and shift anything that isn\\'t really serving us. And when we do it in that state of yoga nidra, we\\'re also able to relate to that unchanging piece of us that is it is not our mind, but can work with it. Yeah, I had not done that before. I had not gone through a nidra practice like this before, and I\\'ve done nidras with you, but I think it was before you started studying this particular lineage. And I really was blown away by how many things I\\'ve already done today. We\\'re filming in mid-afternoon and wow, so many things already happened. And you talked a lot about healing and something that occurred to me just now is how happy I am with so many of the things that I did today that I feel like I was kind to people around me and I was taking on kind of the right priorities for my day. But there were also a couple of things that came to mind that I was like, \"Huh.\" There\\'s a little thing that like it definitely had been better, that interaction could have been kinder there. And yeah, very cool Jes. It does sound like something that would be super helpful at the end of the day, in particular laying in bed. And maybe even then bringing that piece into my sleep. Yeah, if you practice enough, you\\'ll start recalling your subconscious dreams, which that\\'s a whole other topic but it has a lot of information, just information about how the mind is processing our desires in our life. Nice. Well listener, I hope you enjoyed this extra special episode 500 of the SuperDataScience show. Jes, how should people be aware of everything that you do, everything that you have to offer? How can people follow you in the world? Well, I have an Instagram, this is the way of the world today. It\\'s just my name, it\\'s Jes Alan. I do spell my name with one S, so it\\'s J-E-S A-L-L-E-N. The handle has little dots in between each of the letters, but you should find me anyway, just my name. And my website is also jesallen.com, and you can find all my retreats, my online content, mentorship programs. I\\'ll be coming out with some group programs also soon that will be accessible in the virtual world. So both, all my content and interactions are on both of those platforms and they seem to be best and easiest. There\\'s also some free content on SoundCloud as far as yoga nidras, and some meditations go, so you could also start by tuning in there. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you, Jes. And we will include links to all three of those Instagram, website and SoundCloud, which I enjoyed in the run-up to filming this episode as if I needed extra content to be sure that this was the perfect thing for this episode. I did thoroughly enjoy a couple of nidras that you had up on there, on SoundCloud. All right, thank you so much Jes. Have a wonderful rest of your day and we\\'ll catch you again soon. Yeah. Thank you so much for having me, it\\'s beautiful to be here.'\n",

    "doc = 'This is episode number 683 with Dr. Matar Haller, VP of Data and AI at ActiveFence. Today\\'s episode is brought to you by Posit, the open-source data science company, by Anaconda, the world\\'s most popular Python distribution, and by WithFeeling.ai, the company bringing humanity into A.I.Welcome to the SuperDataScience podcast, the most listened-to podcast in the data science industry. Each week, we bring you inspiring people and ideas to help you build a successful career in data science. I\\'m your host, Jon Krohn. Thanks for joining me today. And now let\\'s make the complex simple.Welcome back to the SuperDataScience podcast. Today I\\'m joined by the wildly intelligent data scientist and communicator, Matar Haller. Matar is the Vice President of Data and AI At ActiveFence, an Israeli firm that has raised over a $100 million in venture capital to protect online platforms and their users from malicious behavior and malicious content. She\\'s renowned for her top-rated presentations at leading global data science conferences. She previously worked as Director of Algorithmic AI at SparkBeyond an analytics platform. She holds a PhD in neuroscience from UC Berkeley, and prior to data science, she taught soldiers how to operate tanks. Today\\'s episode has some technical moments that will resonate particularly well with hands-on data science practitioners. But for the most part, the episode will be interesting to anyone who wants to hear from a brilliant person on cutting-edge AI applications. In this episode, Matar details the \"database of evil\" that ActiveFence has amassed for identifying malicious content. How contextual AI considers adjacent and potentially multimodal information when classifying data. How to continuously adapt AI systems to real-world adversarial actors. The machine learning model deployment stack. She uses the data she collected directly from human brains using recording electrodes and how this research relates to the brain-computer interfaces of the future and why being a preschool teacher is a more intense job than the military. All right, you ready for this captivating episode? Let\\'s go.Matar, welcome to the SuperDataScience podcast. It\\'s awesome to have you on the show. Where are you calling in from?Matar Haller:I\\'m calling in from Israel, sunny, sunny Israel. So thanks for having me. Sunny, sunny Israel. Is that always true? Always Sunny Israel. Mhm, most of the time it\\'s pretty sunny. We have like two seasons. One is really long and it\\'s really, really hot. And the other one is shorter and beautiful and not as hot. But still, we have a lot of sun and that\\'s not- [crosstalk] beaches. We have very nice beaches. We, it\\'s, we have tropic-like areas that are like more green and nice, and forests, wildflowers, mountains. Not all camels and deserts, although we have that too. Cool. Well, I guess it isn\\'t cool, but I, sounds hot, but I will have to visit there sometime. I actually, I have a grandmother who recently visited and said that it was her favorite place she\\'s ever been. Oh, wow. Nice. So come visit I\\'ll introduce you to my chickens. There you go. This episode brought to you by the Israel Tourism Board. And, but you do travel a lot as well. So you were recently in New York. You were at MLconf the Machine Learning Conference in New York, which I wasn\\'t able to make it to this year, but you were a speaker at MLconf. And Deborah Williams, who\\'s a friend of mine and the acquisitions editor Pearson that I\\'ve worked with for the books that I\\'ve created, all the video content I\\'ve created, she wrote me a long email summarizing how MLconf had gone. And she said that by far the best speaker hands down, and not just her opinion, but the opinion of \"everyone that she spoke to\" was that you Matar were by far the best speaker at MLconf. So I was like, well, get her on the show. So that\\'s very, very flattering and now like, take your expectations and lower them. Thank you. Very, very flattering. Thank you. That was a fun, that was a fun conference. There\\'s lots of interesting ideas and good, good talks. So it, it was a, if she said that, there, it\\'s, there was a high bar. So thank you. And so let\\'s dig into what you do. So you are the VP of Data and Artificial Intelligence at ActiveFence, which is a platform for content moderation, harmful content detection, and threat intelligence. And so to be clear ActiveFence is not a company that is doing the content moderating. It\\'s not like there\\'s this army of people at ActiveFence that are monitoring for harmful content, but you provide tools, data, and AI-enhanced tools that allow your customers to be able to do that content moderation themselves more efficiently. And this seems to be quite a good niche. I could see on Crunchbase that ActiveFence has over a hundred million dollars in funding. So yeah, it seems like a very valuable niche to be filling for your customers. So tell us a bit about what this means. How do you use AI to be moderating content? How\\'s that useful for threat intelligence, that kind of thing? Sure. So, ActiveFence you\\'re right. Like we are a platform that basically, our clients are any company that has user-generated content. So whether it\\'s you know, comments or chats or uploading videos or audio or any place that you have a user that\\'s able to upload content, there\\'s a potential for misuse of that. And for uploading malicious content. And our goal, our mission is basically to help platforms ensure that their users are safe, that they have safe online interactions. And so we do, we provide the tools to help them, to help them do that. And really one of the, this is one of the biggest challenges that face UGCs, platforms with user-generated content is basically how can they detect this malicious behavior especially since, as we know, items can be in any format, right? So we need to be able to detect whether it\\'s video, audio, text, images all of that. And we, and also it can be in any language, and it can also be any number of violations, right?So you have sort of these, these big ones that, you know, you say absolutely not. Like I do not want child pornography. I do not want terror. I do not want one\\'s supremacy. But, but there\\'s, there\\'s like many, many, many, many more and different, different companies, different platforms have different levels of sensitivity to it, right? Even something that you can say as blatant is like, I do not want child pornography. No one wants child pornography on their platform. But let\\'s define it, right? What does that mean? Is, you know, baby\\'s first bath. Is, is that, is that something that we need to be aware of?And so the tools that we provide need to be sort of contextually aware of, you know, the policy the way that things are being used or presented. And so for me and for all, you know, my teams it\\'s a super, super interesting space to be in because not only are the algorithms that we use really exciting and sort of interesting, but I think the application right, we\\'re not, we\\'re not selling air, like we\\'re actually making it like impact, like making a real impact on like human interactions in a positive way. Right, so to what extent can you tell us about those exciting algorithms? So, that\\'s, that\\'s an excellent question. Thank you for asking. So I think that, so there\\'s many different levels of things that we can do. So the first thing is that we sort of, we have our, a platform, right? And this, this is a platform that basically enables, it enables users to or like moderators, to come in to view the content, to look at sort of where, where it is, and then to make a decision whether or not something should be removed or not, right? And this is the platform that we provide to our users in order to basically ensure that we\\'re being able to protect the wellbeing of the moderators and to make sure that they\\'re only seeing things they actually need to be seen in order to be more efficient. They, there\\'s absolutely no need to review everything. There\\'s like a, most of the things are benign and even within the things that are harmful, there isn\\'t really any need to view anything. Then in that, in that case, basically you want to make sure that you have sort of some sort of automated content moderation on top. And that\\'s where sort of we, we come in. Yes. I guess that that ends up being important for the mental health of the people who are doing the content moderation as well, because I\\'ve read how people in those roles, it can be quite a harrowing experience when you\\'re just watching the headings in child porn all day. Absolutely. Absolutely. Content, like moderator wellbeing is a huge, huge, huge issue. It\\'s in the news, like periodically it comes up as like this, this, this huge thing. And, and ActiveFence is like very, very concerned about this, right? We deal with data that is not pleasant, right? And so in the same way that I actively work to protect my data scientists and my engineers from exposure to this, and only when it\\'s really needed and with a lot of safeguards, we want to make sure that, you know, we\\'re all human and want to make sure that moderators are also protected in the same way. And so if there\\'s things that are sort of blatant, you know, a beheading, why do they need to watch that? There really isn\\'t a need, right? There\\'s things that are clearly, obviously violations are clearly obviously malicious and should just and should just be removed and banned.And so the algorithms that we use, basically we use what we, we what, what we call contextual AI. What this means is that we look at sort of the item in the context that it is being used but also within the item, right? We have a, our data model basically enables us to take sort of an item even if it\\'s just an image, and start breaking it apart into the components that it has, so that then we can build those together into a coherent risk score where this risk score can take into account, you know, what, like, do we see any like weapons? Do we see any known logos? Do we see any known people of interest that we know have, you know, from their history or whatever, we know that they\\'re, you know, spewing hate speech or misinformation and so forth?And then all those components together can combine to basically say, yes, this item is very probably, very probable to be risky. And so that\\'s sort of how we, we build the full picture. And then, of course, there\\'s other layers of that, right? Even for example, for chats, right? You can say, well, I can just use keywords, right? Like, if I find the \"N\" word, then clearly this is very violative. But what if it\\'s someone saying, please don\\'t call me that. Or what if it\\'s a rap song? Or what if it\\'s you know, someone like, you know like community sort of re-owning a word. And so like, you know, I, you know, I\\'m proud to be a whatever some, some slur. And so in those cases, clearly I don\\'t want to ban that. And if I\\'m just doing keywords which are sort of contextually unaware then I lose that ability. And so in those cases, we do need to use sort of language models that are more contextually aware. And these language models need to be trained and tuned on these specific cases. Because these are the cases that are always interesting. That does sound really interesting. And it sounds like the kind of thing that in this brave new world that we have of these really powerful large language models that this is the kind of thing that they could do really well, that a few years ago it might have been a lot tougher. And so it\\'s great that you, that you\\'re presumably able to leverage these kinds of new technologies, especially these kind of multimodal technologies that are emerging. So I don\\'t think it\\'s available to the public yet, but GPT-4 has this image component where you can have an image, you can provide an image, a photo of your fridge, and ask GPT-4, \"What can I cook?\", based on the ingredients that you see in this image. And so that kind of multimodality, it sounds like it\\'s something that you\\'ve been working with for a while. Yeah, we\\'ve been looking a lot at multimodality because for you know, if I\\'m going back to the child pornography example, because that\\'s, for people something that\\'s like so obvious, right? Like, you should be able to know whether something is child porn or not. Like we all sort of viscerally know what is bad. And yet sometimes you\\'ll see, you know, a picture of a child and it looks fine, but, you know, it\\'s sort of like only the people that are in the know will know that, you know, whether like that\\'s a face of a victim that\\'s known, or in the comments, there\\'s links to off-platform sites or something about the angle or a logo that\\'s like, the picture itself is benign, but there\\'s a logo that\\'s associated with a studio that\\'s been associated with child porn or the title or the description.And so sometimes it\\'s enough to look at the image, sometimes it\\'s enough to look at the surroundings. But oftentimes it\\'s the combination. And I mean in terms of like this, the generative AI, right now is this sort of like perfect storm for trust and safety, right? Because we\\'re gonna be having sort of US elections soon, and so political disinformation is something that\\'s like very, very pertinent. And is now sort of having these large language models sort of lowers the bar for the entry of bad actors, right? Suddenly, if it used to be that things could either be like really high quality, but low scale or low quality and easy to catch in high scale, now that\\'s not an issue, right? And so it\\'s like an enabling technology and, you know, can, it\\'s obviously, I don\\'t, like no fear mongering here, I think it\\'s like, has a lot of good that it can do. But we need to be aware of how it can be used and how we can kind of be prepared for it.Jon Krohn:This episode is brought to you by Posit: the open-source data science company. Posit makes the best tools for data scientists who love open source. Period. No matter which language they prefer. Posit\\'s popular RStudio IDE and enterprise products, like Posit Workbench, Connect, and Package Manager, help individuals, teams, and organizations scale R & Python development easily and securely. Produce higher-quality analysis faster with great data science tools. Visit Posit.co—that’s P-O-S-I-T dot co—to learn more.Yeah, no question. So we, you know, famously in the United States, in the 2008 election cycle, there was a lot of, there were foreign actors involved in creating disinformation in Eastern European kind of farms. And you can imagine exactly like you\\'re saying, these kinds of tools like GPT-4 make it a lot easier to create a lot more content. Cause you don\\'t need to have a human typing out everything so much more cheaply. It probably like several orders of magnitude less expensive to be generating malicious content, misleading content, disinformation. So yeah, it is interesting that yeah, heading into yeah, and I mean, I guess we\\'re always heading into an election cycle somewhere. [crosstalk] And so it\\'s something- It never ends. Like, yeah, it\\'s crazy in the US to me that people in the, in the lower house that they have a two-year election cycle, and so like, you spend a few months litigating then is back to fundraising.Matar Haller:Exactly.Jon Krohn:It\\'s wild. Yeah. But, but, but I think it\\'s, what\\'s interesting is that like disinformation is only one aspect of it, right? We\\'re seeing like computer generated or, you know generative AI-generated child pornography. And then at this point, the question is it still violative? And I think yes, right? Like, we don\\'t want that stuff out there. I don\\'t care whether something is real or fake. It\\'s, it\\'s still child porn and it should be, it should be banned. And then, and then there\\'s a second level of like, well, unless I\\'m trying to find who the victim is, and then I do care, and then there\\'s like another level of detection that needs to be built on top of that. Is it tricky? I mean, it must be tricky. Something that must add an extra level of complexity to this is that presumably the nefarious actors out there are constantly shifting and trying to evade detection by you. So, in, with, when many of our listeners and myself, when we\\'re building machine learning models, we don\\'t have to worry about somebody trying to outwit the model. You know, like you can build a machine learning classifier to detect images of cats and dogs, and it\\'s not like the cats are like trying to look like dogs and are gonna come up with ways of like, dressing to look more like dogs. So, ... Yeah, no, I mean, I think I may think about it in terms of like, how, how is what I do different from car detection, right? Like that\\'s sort of, you know, or cat detection or anything. Or, yeah. Anyway, there\\'s a million examples. And so I think there\\'s, in addition to the fact that it\\'s evasive and adversarial, right? So there\\'s, you know, examples of like QAnon, which is a group that\\'s bands on some platforms will, you know, change their text to be cue, like C U E. And then you have to basically catch it by knowing to look for that. And to know to look for that, that\\'s already subject matter expertise. And that\\'s one thing [inaudible] we have, you know, you mentioned threat intelligence. And so we have intelligence analysts that this is what they do, right?They, they\\'re experts in, you know, misinformation or in hate speech and or in terror and research these groups, they know about sort of the latest hashtags or trends like what emojis they\\'re using now and so forth. And then basically that is able to, you know, they\\'re able to sort of surface data that\\'s relevant. You know, for example, you know, the latest, there\\'s, you know a hate group that was founded in like this last June or this last October, and they\\'re already, you know, on, on different social networks with their logos spewing hate. And so to catch those, to know those to put, and then those can feed back into our algorithms, and I can know to look for those logos, to look for those phrases, to look for those actors. And so then I\\'m able to sort of stay on top of it on the fact that yes, it\\'s adversarial.I have the subject of matter expertise. It\\'s extremely non-stationary, right? I have new actors coming up all the time, right? If I\\'m looking for cats and dogs, like how much have they really changed? They\\'re, they\\'re not gonna change, right? Right. They\\'re gonna have four legs, a tail, and ears versus here the landscape is very non, because it\\'s adversarial, it\\'s extremely non-stationary. And so that\\'s why I need to have my subject matter experts that are constantly feeding me more information of like, oh, this is a new slang term. Oh, this is a new slur. And so forth.Jon Krohn:Is there a flywheel that gives active defense, a defensible moat between this content moderation and the threat intelligence? So I\\'m just kind of, I was, I just kind of had this brainwave here, and you can correct me if I\\'m thinking about this incorrectly, but, so you have the content moderation aspect of the platform. So machine learning models are detecting \"Hey, you know, we think that there\\'s, this is high-risk content over here\" automatically. And then maybe that automation can assist the threat intelligence part of the company. And then the threat intelligence people in turn are keeping tabs on what\\'s going on through a combination of more manual intelligence work, as well as this automated automatically assisted intelligence work that your content moderation side is helping with. And then they can feed back into the content moderation. Like, \"Hey, like, here\\'s something else you need to be able to look for. We need to train a machine learning model to be able to check this kind of thing\". Because yeah, like, you know, there\\'s this new logo that you need to be looking out for. Totally. You nailed it. Yeah. We love flywheels at ActiveFence. We always say like, no strategy deck is complete without a flywheel. And so, and so, absolutely. It\\'s exactly as you described. So we have our intelligence analysts that are, you know, finding, finding things, right? Those feed into the algorithms, make our algorithms better, and then we have incoming data collection, whether the data is like we go out and practically collect it, or we get data, you know, clients are sending us data being like, \"Hey, is this violated or not?\" and then that\\'s basically can then be fed back into the intelligence analysts. So for things that come from clients, sometimes it\\'s things that they haven\\'t seen before that they, that they don\\'t know. Often they do know it, but because we\\'re also out there collecting data proactively, then that\\'s basically able to feed back in.And one core component of this flywheel is something that is we\\'ve, we\\'ve, it\\'s our proprietary database. It\\'s sort of a violative content. And what this means is that basically we have data that we\\'ve already identified, whether it\\'s images or audio or videos or texts that we\\'ve already identified as being violative of a policy or malicious, we can hash that. And then new content that comes in can be compared to that, right? And then that also helps us, first of all, to be more efficient. But also we can proactively enlarge. We don\\'t need to wait for data to come in, right? We can proactively enlarge this proprietary database by going out there, going to sources that we know are problematic and that\\'s what our intelligence analyst can help us with. And then next time that it comes in, basically we\\'ve, we\\'ve already seen it before. And so there\\'s definitely this sort of interaction, the flywheel between the intelligence analysts, the humans and the AI, one sort of feeding off the other. Yes. So this is the database of evil that you\\'ve talked about publicly before, right? And so to give a bit of an analogy, this is kind of like how antivirus solutions have a database of known viruses, and then if that line of code that\\'s known to be malicious is come across on your own hardware, that can be compared against this database, and you can say, okay, this is the threat. We need to remove this part of your file system. So similarly, you have this database of bad content, of harmful content and yeah, it\\'s proprietary. So, okay, that, I think that, yeah, you have more to say about that. So my, the more thing that I have to say about that is only that to bring us back to the, to the idea that we\\'re in an adversarial space. And if we sort of keep this in mind, it\\'s like we\\'re in the space that\\'s adversarial, that requires subject matter expertise, it\\'s, or it\\'s adversarial or invasive, requires subject matter expertise. It\\'s non-stationary, it\\'s multi-dimensional. And so once we keep those and, and it requires context, and once we keep those in mind, then it sort of helps us frame how we want to use this database of evil. But also, or this proprietary base, but also like what it needs to sort of be robust against, right? So if we\\'re in a place that requires subject matter expertise, ensure, then we can keep enlarging our data, like all of our databases, right, with our intelligence analysts, and it\\'s non-stationary. So we need to make sure that it\\'s always updated. Like having a snapshot of this database isn\\'t enough, right? There\\'s gonna be new things.But also if we\\'re, if we\\'re in a place that\\'s inherently adversarial, then we need to make sure that this database is also robust to adversarial manipulations. What does that mean? For example, if I have like a very hateful song like, you know, glorifying the Holocaust, for example like a love song glorifying the Holocaust, right? These things exist. Then, and I know that this is banned on platforms, then I can speed it up, right? And then in the comments, or in the title or summary, I can say, listen to this at half speed. And then now, now I\\'ve basically like made it against all, you know, made it past all kinds of defenses.And so we need to make sure, and the same thing with images, right? I can like rotate it, I can grayscale it, I can mirror it, I can do all sorts of things. And so I need to make sure that my hashing any hashing algorithm that I have is robust to these manipulations up to a point, right? Because I\\'m always gonna, it\\'s always this idea of like precision versus recall. Like, do I want to now unfairly capture things that shouldn\\'t be captured, right? And unfairly say that they are violative, probably not. And so it\\'s a tricky line, but it\\'s, it\\'s, that\\'s the line that is when any content moderation algorithm we\\'re always trying to figure out what, where things should, where the boundaries should go. And I guess that\\'s key to why having a human in the loop in these kinds of decisions so that people can, if they\\'re unfairly forced to remove content, there should be some kind of appeals process in the platform, or yeah, or human reviewer that can make some final decisions. So I guess kind of going back to a point earlier in the conversation, when something is really flagrant and your risk score, which I assume is kind of similar to in machine learning, having a binary classifier where you have a confidence on yeah, whether, how likely is this to be malicious content, harmful content? And so if that is very high, if you\\'re like, okay, this is 0.99999, we\\'re just like, there\\'s no point in sending this to a human to review. But if it\\'s 0.8 or 0.7, then like there might be something here somebody should review before a decision is made. And yeah, same thing on the flip side, when it\\'s, yeah, even things that are, yeah, so if something does get flagged automatically, because there\\'s still, everything is probabilistic in machine learning.So there\\'s gonna be cases where the algorithm is very confident and there\\'s still in and due to some circumstance you\\'re describing where like a group has re-owned something that has been a racial slur historically there should be the opportunity for that person to say \"no, like, I have,\" like \"I should be able to\", yeah, so these, so it kind of works both ways. So our risk score exactly as you describe, and like, everything is probabilistic and also it\\'s, it\\'s a business use case where they want to, like how much manual view they want, right? Like maybe for a child\\'s like a platform for children, they say, you know what, just ban everything. Like, so what if the kids like can\\'t chat about, you know, it\\'s fine. But maybe for like other platforms, like a news platform- The kids can\\'t chat about racial slurs. Yeah, but fine, I, I\\'m okay with that. Like, I don\\'t care for me. My kids can just like type three words. That\\'s okay. And my, my kids are anyway, they\\'re own, they\\'re getting cell phones when they\\'re 35. Like until then, deal with it. But yeah, but so, so it\\'s exactly that, right? But other platforms would be like, you know what, even if it\\'s at, at 99, like for the things that are 90 nines, like, we, we want to review them because we\\'d, we would rather err on the side of like free speech or whatever. And so I think that also in terms of appeals, that\\'s super important point. That\\'s something that is definitely critical in this because this is like, you know, people are posting things and they don\\'t want to be unfairly punished.And actually right now I think that the world of trust and safety is having its GDPR moment, right? Like GDPR was, is for those who that are not familiar, it was like privacy regulation passed into EU that ended up having huge sweeping effect because it was basically any time that a EU that a citizen of the EU is on an online platform, then GDPR is effect, like, is effective on them in terms of like, you know what cookies and what can be stored and, and so forth. And you\\'ve probably all seen, like, you know, the notifications on your browsers about privacy regulations. And so now trust in safety is having its GDPR moment with the DSA which is a digital services act. It\\'s passed by the EU last year. And it basically also puts in protections for trust and safety. It codifies them by law in sort of, in a similar way with fines and so forth. And while it\\'s still new for smaller tech companies. Big, like the very big online companies, they have, like, they\\'re already, it\\'s like already being rolling in and they\\'re rolling out and there\\'s like very strict regulations on them that they need to follow. And it\\'ll, it\\'ll trickle down probably to everyone. And so like regulation, fines are on the table.And so these businesses need these tools to be compliant. And part of that is also auditing and understanding. Like, part of the DSA is like auditing and understanding why things were banned and, and explaining it and so forth. And so that\\'s another thing that we invest in is explainability, right? Like if I\\'m giving a score, then I want to be able to explain why. Like, because a lot of times these things are, you need that subject matter expertise to understand that, oh, like this particular logo is actually associated with this particular terra group or hate group, or child pornography studio or whatever. Nice. Yeah. So I can see how the evolving regulatory landscape ends up being important, probably helpful to you as you develop these algorithms. We\\'ve talked already about harmful content kind of in static in you know, in posted content. But there\\'s also, there\\'s something that we hear a lot in the news recently, we, we see increasingly in the news is not just content that\\'s been posted, but content that is streaming real-time. So there have been incidences in the US recently of shootings being live-streamed to social media platforms. And so this happening in real-time, that must add an extra layer of complexity to some of the work that you\\'re doing. Absolutely. There\\'s been like horrific instances of live streaming in the US and, and elsewhere. And so there\\'s a couple of ways to approach that. One of which is that you, we can put really, really small content moderation model is sort of on the edge device, right? So that, that does sort of some something basic to catch sort of the blatant stuff and then, you know, raise it up for, for human review. Cause I think in these, in these cases of, of live streams, it\\'s, it\\'s tricky. We\\'re still learning the space and we would want someone to just, like, if we flag it to take a look at it maybe err on the side of flagging too much, and then having someone take a look at it, again, it\\'s, it\\'s always, it\\'s a business question of like, what\\'s the platform? What, what are we looking for?And so, you know, have some sort of like detector of, I don\\'t know, gunshots or of something that\\'s that, you know, a small [inaudible] model edge device able to flag it right away. We can also do something where we are, you know, once the content makes it to the servers sample frame, like there\\'s a question of like, what do you want to moderate? Like every single frame? Do you want to sample every minute, every second? Like at what there\\'s, there\\'s a huge question. I think what makes this so challenging is just the scale, right? You have like so much data streaming in and then do the same thing, sample, and then look for maybe more, more complex things, right? So those are sort of like the typical things, and that\\'s where you\\'re really focusing on the content itself, right, that\\'s coming in.But a lot of these times when, when you\\'re, when you\\'re live streaming something like this, then you know the perpetrator may have like, you know, pre-shared this somewhere. There\\'s people that are, you know, joining the stream that are commenting, and now it\\'s now suddenly you have a much, much richer source of information, right? You can look at who are the other users, who is the user that\\'s streaming, what else have they streamed in the past? What, what other groups are they been in? What are people writing in the comments like and so forth. And suddenly now you might be able to catch it or at least flag it just from the surrounding information, right? Like there\\'s, there\\'s enough indicators of risk from the things that are around it where sure, you want to moderate the content, you want to look at it and so forth. However, you would want to basically look at the other markets of risk around the content itself to make your job easier and faster, and more efficient. Did you know that Anaconda is the world’s most popular platform for developing and deploying secure Python solutions faster? Anaconda’s solutions enable practitioners and institutions around the world to securely harness the power of open source. And their cloud platform is a place where you can learn and share within the Python community. Master your Python skills with on-demand courses, cloud-hosted notebooks, webinars and so much more!

Yep, that\\'s 30 days of free Python training at superdatascience.com/anacondaGotcha. So, yeah, so it obviously is more complex to be moderating harmful content when you are thinking about it in a real-time situation. But as you point out, having smaller threat detection models on the edge device, so on mobile phones, maybe on laptops, being able to detect these issues in real-time and potentially flag those to the social media platform. And then also once the real-time data is reaching the servers of these platforms, you can be sampling at some appropriate interval in order to be trying to detect whether harmful content, so yeah, the sound of gunshots, and then so it can be reviewed as to whether this is like video game gunshots or not. And then something so probably in a circumstance like that, whether it\\'s real-world gunshots or video game gunshots, we\\'re going to be able to tell more easily because of the contextual information that surrounds that. So the kind of text that people post in response is probably going to be quite different and classifiable different in a video game where people there might be more like well, I don\\'t want to even speculate on what- Yeah, love, yeah. But, but, but I would say that, you know, if we\\'re thinking, if we\\'re thinking about it and like, I\\'m kind of thinking it, thinking out loud and like refining of it, what I said earlier is that, so you have something on the edge device that does like you know, more basic, like smaller model that does more basic content moderation. And then instead of it flagging human, like remember that everything is making it to the cloud. And so we\\'re sampling. And so things that have been flagged by the edge device can then either have like more like different, like more tightly spaced samples or can have more deeper analysis on it. Like, it, it\\'s, it\\'s basically a funnel, right? And again, it depends what you discover on the edge device. Like maybe you might want to right away flag it too and be like, listen, like there\\'s, this is not something that, that is very likely to be in the gray zone.And then also you can look at the surrounding content. You don\\'t need to wait for the content to be uploaded to serve anything, right? Like, you have the surrounding content, it\\'s like text and who the user is, and like, where, you know, do, do we recognize this user? Where else have they posted before? The users that are commenting, like, where else are they? And this is where actually, like a graphical data model comes in handy, right? Because now you have all these relations between users and you can see like, what have they liked before, what groups are they in who have they interacted with, and so forth. And then if these are people that are known to us, then we can say, well actually, like this is a user that if we see them here, this is, it adds to the probability of risk.Jon Krohn:All right. So Matar, you\\'ve given us a interesting overview of how content moderation works in your automated platform for detecting harmful content. So things like contextual AI needing to be able to adapt to adversarial opponents, the flywheel between content moderation and threat intelligence that\\'s helpful to you. The \"database of evil\" and how there\\'s flexibility in the way that information\\'s hashed in there so that you can be detecting new variations that are adjacent to existing known harmful content. And then most recently we just talked about the specific circumstances of real-time streaming and how we can be addressing harmful content in those circumstances. So very interesting. And so I\\'m curious to what extent you can tell us about the kinds of technologies that you use to make the platform happen. So, you know, what kinds of programming languages, obviously we\\'re not, you can\\'t get into a level of detail that would allow adversarial actors to be more effective than adversarially- Adversarial actors listen in now. Yeah, so I, and again I\\'m giving it with the caveat that like, the parts that of that I deal with are sort of like the, the data, the MLOps, the engineering, the API, the world of front end is beautiful, mysterious to me. So I can like list technologies that use there, but they don\\'t mean that much to me. I\\'m more, I\\'ve always been sort of like a backend geek. And so in terms of that, we do obviously data people do Python, duh. We also use Node and TypeScript. We serve our models on Kubernetes. We have, we\\'ve done a lot of work in-house of selecting of like writing stuff to basically select the correct instance type for a given model so that you get really good, the best utilization.We\\'ve also, are working on like model-in versus model-out being like, do we bake the model into the image or does the, or do we like, or when we spin up the pod, like do we bring the model from outside basically in order to maximize our or minimize our uptime? Because we basically need to be able to deal with really, really high throughput and low latency. And so and also we don\\'t want to be just like burning money on machines that are up for no reason. And so we have HPA that we then tune, and then we can basically spin up and spin down our machines as we need and then be smart about which machines we\\'re spinning up. And also if we\\'re able to sometimes sort of put multiple models on the machine or batch the requests to the machine and we do all sorts of optimizations to make sure that we\\'re high through put SLA. Nice, very interesting, thank you for being able to go into even that level of detail. So clearly you have a really deep understanding of not just data science and modeling, but of backend engineering. So like scaling, being able to meet SLAs, Kubernetes. So, super interesting. I didn\\'t know from my research beforehand that you had that kind of expertise as well. So let\\'s dig into your background a little bit to see how this all came about. So you did a neuroscience PhD at UC Berkeley which is I think, a great decision. I also did a neuroscience PhD. So I, for me, that was something that I got into it because I was fascinated as to how chemicals, biology, physics create a conscious experience. And so like everything that you think, everything that you do in some way that we obviously are nowhere near fully elucidating can be reduced down to physical processes.And so I wanted to dig into that as much as I could. But then as I got started in the PhD, I was like, wow dataset sizes are getting really big. It seems like there\\'s really interesting things that we could be doing there, detecting patterns in data, identifying causal direction in data. And so I went down this road of focusing on programming and machine learning because I knew that whether I stayed in academia or not, those would be transferrable skills. And I\\'m not surprised, I guess that that ended up being true. However so in your PhD, I know that you were recording activity from surgically implanted electrodes in human brains. And I made this joke before we started recording about how, you know, I felt, you know, I really feel like I made the right choice sticking to silicon experiments or analyzing data as opposed to doing things in you know, learning how to implant electrodes into a ferret.And I was making this joke about how, you know, people in my cohort, in my PhD were doing that kind of thing. But then the exact person that I was thinking of ended up has a really nice job at Google DeepMind. So there\\'s, so it seems like you have insight into that. So I ended up getting here [crosstalk], but we kind of have this. So tell us about your PhD, how that relates to work you\\'re doing today. There\\'s also, there\\'s the Insight Data Science Fellowship program that you used to transition from your PhD from your academic background into industrial data science. So it\\'d be interesting to hear about that. And then to finally, have it all make sense, as to how I started off this entire long transition is that I mentioned how you have, it\\'s, you have a rich understanding of the backend of a software platform. And so just kind of how this all came about your rich depth of knowledge in the field. Yes. The first question, let\\'s start with, with the first one. So my PhD, so yes, my PhD. I was recording electrodes, recording data from electrodes surgical implanted in human brains. Basically what I wanted was, you know, animal-quality data from humans, right? With animal research you can stick electrodes where you want, get really beautiful data. You could do in slices. You could do you know, from trained monkeys for years to do a task and, and then get just beautiful recordings of just like signals for hours and hours of neurons at work. And with humans, you\\'re often limited to things that are either slow, so FMRI, and it\\'s like, you know, you see it many, many, many, many, many degrees removed. You\\'re actually measuring blood flow. You\\'re not even measuring like direct brain activity. So you\\'re like measuring a side effect of thinking. Or you can do EEG, which is then, you know electrical signals filtered through the scalp. And even with, with technologies like MEG and so forth which is magnetoencephalography, it\\'s, it\\'s not the same. You\\'re not, you\\'re not at, you\\'re not on the brain. And then this really unique opportunity opens up in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Knight at Berkeley which [inaudible] is basically to work with patients that are undergoing brain surgery often for epilepsy. So epilepsy that can\\'t be treated with medicine right? They keep having recurrent seizures. And so the only solution is to go and to surgically remove the problematic area of the brain. However before that\\'s done, you need to map out the brain to ensure that, you know, you stop the seizures, but the person is left, you know aphasic, like they can\\'t speak, or you stop seizures and suddenly they can\\'t, you know, they\\'re blind.And so what you want to do is you want to basically map out the areas of the cortex around the region of interest to ensure that first of all, you can localize exactly where the seizure is. Because remember, until you really get in there, everything is filtered through the scalp and you have, like, it\\'s really, you can\\'t tell. And so to figure out like where the focal point is and also what\\'s around it. And so these people, basically, what happens is they come in for surgery they have a craniotomy. The scalp is, the skull is removed, the electrodes are implanted and then they\\'re bandaged up, and then they\\'re in the hospital for a week with electrodes coming out of their brain, hooked up to a pre-emp, and then to an amp. And the best-case scenario for, and then their meds are tapered. And there, there\\'s, there\\'s all kinds of things.All, many, many things are done to try to induce a seizure, because the best-case scenario is basically on the first day they have seizures. You localize it, you figure out exactly what\\'s around it, and then like the next day they\\'re, they\\'re in surgery, they remove it, and you\\'re done. Oftentimes, that\\'s not the case. You need to work to induce a seizure, sleep deprivation, strobe lights, all sorts of things to get them, right and so we could, most of the time these people are like sitting in the hospital just kind of like waiting around, right, watching TV or, you know, whatever. And then we come in and, and if they, if they consent, then, then we can come and we can run all sorts of tasks based, we ensure that the task is matched to the regions of the brain that are mapped, right? There\\'s no point in doing a memory task if, you know, the parts of the brain are only motor and so forth, or a motor task if they\\'re only looking at language regions.And I found this job like very, very meaningful in terms of science outreach, like explain to them the value that they have for science and why I\\'m doing what I\\'m doing. And I spent a lot of time just, you know, talking to them about the brain and about my research and so forth. I also found it like emotionally incredibly difficult because you\\'re meeting these people pretty much at the worst time of their lives, right, like, this is just a terrible situation to be in. And so it\\'s, it\\'s challenging, it\\'s rewarding, it\\'s basically, you know, in a way that you don\\'t expect your PhD to be, right? Like, you go and you\\'re like, gimme data, I\\'ll analyze data. Great. And then there\\'s, there\\'s this.And so I would come in and I would, the task that I was interested in, I was basically interested in sort of tracking the path of a decision in the brain. So I would basically, in the beginning I just had my one task, but thenI realized that basically all tasks that we recorded decision tasks. So I entered into like, dip my foot into like the world of, you know, big data where I could basically take all the tasks that were run. And anytime that there\\'s sort of a decision to be made, then you have sort of like a motor decision, right? Like you see a stimulus, right? So that goes, or you hear something, so that goes into like your visual cortex or through auditory cortex, and then it needs to make it to the decision making area of the brain, right, the prefrontal cortex, which is where sort of moves forward in the brain. You need to make a decision.The decision is made, and then it needs to go back to the motor cortex to execute the decision. And what I want to do is I basically tracked that, that loop in the brain and was basically able to look at the activity in the prefrontal cortex and basically say, aha, look like the sustained activity that I see in the prefrontal cortex correlates with, you know, the reaction time, right? I\\'m able to sort of see when they\\'ll trigger a reaction without looking at the motor cortex. I can look, I can see errors, I can see that like the amplitude is also correlated with errors and basically tracking a thought through the brain. And because I was on the brain I had extremely fast like recordings of what was going on. So it wasn\\'t filtered through anything. The future of AI shouldn’t be just about productivity.

I really did just sit at a computer and, like learn the programming languages and machine learning algorithms, which was interesting. But wow. I mean, yeah, you\\'re really doing real valuable work. And so I think some of that work would go back to like Wilder Penfield. Yes. So that\\'s, that\\'s when you\\'re actually looking and you\\'re, yeah, I mean, that\\'s like the Wilder Penfield is like the grandfather of, of everything that we did. The electrodes that I was using, and again, like things here moved really, really fast. And my PhD was a while ago. I\\'m not dating myself, but it, it wasn\\'t yesterday. And electrodes have gotten since then smaller. There\\'s also a lot of single-unit recordings where you can actually put in an electrode and record from like smaller populations, right? My electrodes were, were pretty big and kind of far apart. So I\\'m recording from larger populations, but yes, it all comes back to like classic neuroscience. And as I was doing it, so that\\'s like the data collection, right? But then you collect the data and it\\'s such a rich dataset that like they can sustain you forever.And like the data sets that I collected are still being used for studies because it\\'s like, so it\\'s like rare data. It\\'s expensive data, it\\'s rich data. You can look at it many different ways. And so I took my data and data from other studies and then, and as I was, as I was working, I said, you know, the brain is amazing, right? There\\'s like, no, I don\\'t think anyone in our field can argue about that. However, what I found myself like drawn to where the algorithms, the machine learning, the statistics, the signal processing, the programming languages, like all of the things that maybe you would say, \"oh, those are just the methods\", I found that those, that those were the parts of the papers that I was reading, those are like the algorithms. Those were the parts that I was like most drawn to. And so then it was kind of like a natural transition from there to be like, okay, like this is, this is what I, this is what I\\'m actually more, more interested in most of the time. So that was how I found myself there. I did an, like an NLP class towards the end of my PhD, kind of in secret. And then like the rest is history.Jon Krohn:Nice. Yeah. And then the Insight Program. So we\\'ve had guests on in the past that did this fellowship as well. So it\\'s intended for, I think primarily people who have already done an academic PhD, have a strong quantitative background like you did. You were doing tons of, like you say machine learning, kind of data science techniques. So things like time series analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering, regression, data permutation. So you had all this existing experience. And then, so the Insight Data Science Program was that a useful transition after you\\'ve done all that? You\\'d done the secret NLP course, and yeah, was that still useful for making the transition to industry? Oh, absolutely. Insight Data Science is wonderful. They, what they do is they basically, they take people that, you know, we already have all of these skills and we\\'ve done, we\\'ve done data science and you know, we\\'ve done machine learning and we\\'ve done programming, but we\\'re totally, totally clueless about the real world because we\\'re academics, right? We know nothing. And basically they help us sort of frame what we\\'ve done in the context of industry. So talking about like startups, and funding, and jobs, and like, what is it like to work? And then also things just like best, best practices, right? Like, you know, version control and things like that, which some people do in their PhD, some people don\\'t do, like, some people\\'s PhD is like a hundred percent in like a Jupyter in like a single Jupyter notebook. And so basically like they kind of get you up to speed for like, and like some, like for gaps that you have there, but also just frame what you\\'ve done in the context of, okay, this is industry, like here is why what you have is valuable here is how you can use the things that you\\'ve done in industry.So they show, you know, people come in, they sort of like, you know, \"Hey, look, here\\'s how, here\\'s like fraud detection at this company.\" And you\\'re like, \"Oh, hey. Like I, I, I\\'ve done that.\" and sort of kind of tie it together for you. Also, you know like salary negotiation, like all, all of these like things. And then at the, what, what you end up doing is they say, okay, in your PhD you had like 5, 6, 7 years to work on something. Now you have three weeks to put together a project that actually brings concrete impact that like can bring, be impactful, and that you can like pitch it. And then that kind of puts you in the mindset of like, what is a POC? And that also helps employers get around the bias of like, \"God, I don\\'t want to hire an academic, like I\\'ll never get anything done.\" Right, right, right. And I think there\\'s, there\\'s a lot of relationships between Insight and future employers. Lots of employers are looking for great data science talent, like the people that are intaken into the Insight Data Science Program. And so yes, you end up with this flywheel. So, and I just, I want to quickly go back before we transition away from what you were doing with your PhD and how you got to what you\\'re doing today. I just, I want to talk a little bit more about, so I mentioned Wilder Penfield and how he was, so he was, I guess, the first person to be able to map the human cortex to the level of detail. And it was, I think it was the same situation. It was, it was many decades ago, like the 1950s or something.But same kind of thing. Stroke patients, open skull, and so recording from these individual electrodes over the whole brain. And so that gave this map of the whole, so there\\'s this somatic sensory homunculus and this motor homunculus. So it\\'s this like, really cool. I encourage our listeners, and I\\'ll try to remember to include in the show notes a link to some images of this homunculus that it shows you, so I think homunculus is Latin for like little man. And so it\\'s the idea of this when you, as you go over the motor cortex or the sensory cortex in the brain, there\\'s this map of your body. And it isn\\'t anatomically correct in terms of scale. So for example for both the sensory as well as the homunculus the hands are huge because, so, because you have so much you have so much detailed sensory perception as well as motor perception in your hands. And I remember like the lips are huge-Matar Haller:Lips, the tongue. But yes, [crosstalk] back is small. Yeah. Exactly. I think we had the same textbook. So one thing you could do is you could take a, you could take a paperclip, right? And you can like put it together. So like the, it\\'s points are like at some distance apart. And you could find like, what is the closest distance on your back basically that you\\'re, that you can tell them apart. Because at some point, like you just, you\\'re not sensitive enough on your back to tell them apart. And then you put on your lips and immediately you\\'re like, oh, wow, these are super far apart. And that basically is reflective of the fact that you have less representation, less sensory representation of your back than of your lips in your, in your sensory strip.Jon Krohn:Cool. So yeah, so I wanted to recap on that. Oh, and then, yeah. So, so, and there, I, there\\'s a very specific reason why I brought this back up, not just because it\\'s really interesting, which I think it is in and of itself, but you were talking about how recording electrodes, so I was thinking about how the recording electrodes that while the Penfield would\\'ve been working with many decades ago, not many centuries, many decades ago. Wow. Thousands of years ago. This podcast will be listened to for millennia. It\\'ll all be confusing. So the recording electrodes would\\'ve been much bigger that he was working with than you were working with. And you were talking about how in recent years they\\'ve become even smaller. And so then that got me thinking about how there is this push with companies like Elon Musk\\'s Neurolink to have brain-computer interfaces eventually that aren\\'t just for people who have serious issues and have their skull opened. But there\\'s this move towards, in our lifetime, potentially having some way of having recording electrodes on our brains without needing to have invasive surgery. And so I don\\'t know if you have any thoughts on that. And I also, I\\'m gonna be asking you after this episode as to whether you happen to know any amazing guests that could dig deep into that topic here. Ah, yeah, I have some ideas. So I, so not all, so actually even today, not all brain commuter interface is super invasive. I mean, it\\'s invasive in the sense that like, you have an electrode in the brain, like that\\'s invasive, right? But not far all you need like a craniotomy that opens everything, right? So for example, you have for Parkinson\\'s patients deep brain stimulation, right? Where they\\'re, they basically hold they put in an electrode very, very specific to the substantial nigra, which is a place in the brainstem where- The black substance.Matar Haller:Yeah, there you go. Someone remembers their neuroanatomy. Where, where basically you know produces dopamine, and then when cells there start to die then, then you need to basically stimulate it in order to get around the fact that you\\'re not, it\\'s, it\\'s not functioning. And so that, that\\'s, again, that\\'s just like an electrode that\\'s brought in and that\\'s used to stimulate and actually there\\'s like you know, how do you decide how much to stimulate or whatever, there\\'s like a, like a device that you can like calibrate and then decide how much to stimulate. And so that\\'s, you know, that doesn\\'t require massive craniotomy. I mean, that\\'s already like a feedback loop that you have that\\'s, it\\'s been, it\\'s been around for a really long time.You also have things that are more invasive, but long-term. So the patients that I was discussing, they basically have it have the electrodes in temporarily, right? They\\'re, they have the craniotomy, the electrodes are put in wires coming out of the head. Once they have seizures and everything\\'s localized in the best case, they remove it, skulls back in, electrodes gone. However, there\\'s also different companies for example, NeuroPace which they actually permanently implant an electrode strip in the person\\'s brain. And then they\\'re able to basically record ongoing. And the idea is that they\\'re able to predict or give some sort of like leadway before a seizure happens, and then stimulate they stimulate to stop the seizure. And, and they, and they record and then that\\'s uploaded to their servers. And so, and that\\'s already, that\\'s also already there. That\\'s like, there\\'s patients walking around with it right now.And so I think Elon Musks\\' is like the next step of that where it\\'s like, okay, it\\'s not clinical and let\\'s say how we can get it smaller and smaller. So, if we think about like Moore\\'s Law, what he said about things getting like, you know more and more fitting and getting smaller and smaller it, I think, I think, we\\'ll be there, we\\'ll be there shortly. And then it\\'s a matter of like what, like how, how do you make it minimally invasive? How do you make it so that, because at some point, like in terms of like, how long can it be in before cells start to die, before the body starts to reject it? And basically there\\'s a difference between just recording and stimul and versus stimulating and what does it mean to like stimulate and at what frequency?And I think there\\'s some really, really interesting questions, because already we see. So here\\'s another tangent. We see that brains oscillate, right? So we have like oscillations in the brain basically where there\\'s different frequency bands that are associated with like, different processes, right? So like alpha, which is between 8-12 HZ, that\\'s often for like visual cortex, but it\\'s you have beta, which is like 15 to 30 Hz, and that\\'s for motor movement, like when you initiate, when you initiate motor movement, you have beta suppression. So there\\'s things like that. But what we do, what we also see, is that there\\'s individual variability between these frequency bands, right? So like, my beta is not your beta, my alpha is not your alpha, my theta is not your theta, and so forth.And so anytime that now we\\'re gonna go in and we\\'re gonna start stimulating, you\\'re gonna say, okay, well I\\'m gonna stimulate a particular frequency, but what is that frequency, right? And how do I determine that frequency? And how do I know what frequency is ideal for me versus for you, for whatever the results are. Now this is like, again, right now it\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s far away. But if, but we, we, there, there are already like stimulation protocols that we see even completely non-invasive. Like, there\\'s things with TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation where people have been experimenting with that. And there\\'s also research about using stimulation for psychiatric disorders and so forth. So there, it\\'s, it\\'s a huge, huge field. And hopefully that wasn\\'t too much of a tangent. No, not at all. I obviously found it super fascinating. And I mean, I think that any of these kinds of, any of these kinds of discussions around how we can be using technologies to adapt our brains either to resolve some you know, some, some negative issue like you\\'re saying from strokes to psychiatric issues all the way through to potentially having enhancements which is, I know like, you know, some of these brain-computer interface, BCI technologies are designed to, yeah, not just be for resolving issues, but also to potentially augment human capabilities in ways that probably we can\\'t predict yet. So I don\\'t know. I think it\\'s super, super interesting and yes, I will be following up with you to see if you have other recommendations for people who can dig into kind of a BCI episode.So you mentioned Matar, how your PhD was more intense than some other people\\'s PhDs, neuroscience PhDs, certainly much more intense than orders of magnitude more intense than my PhD was in terms of like being really in the real world and dealing with patients. But that isn\\'t your only intense job that you had. So, am I reading this correctly? You were teaching children how to use tanks? Preschool tank instructor? No, wait, it\\'s two separate items. Yeah. So you were a preschool teacher, you were also a tank instructor. So I\\'m curious as to whether those experiences helped you prepare for your career and in particular, maybe this might seem tangential, but it wouldn\\'t surprise me if somehow this does tie into an answer, which is that I know that you\\'re passionate about expanding leadership opportunities for Women in STEM careers, including data science. And so I wonder if we can somehow tie those two topics together. Yeah, sure. Why not? So, so my military, so in Israel there\\'s a mandatory military service. I actually did kind of like a strange route when normally when you\\'re 18 you basically, that\\'s when you start your military service. I actually did my undergrad- You went to Berkeley.Matar Haller:I did.Jon Krohn:Right. Yeah. You went to Berkeley for an undergrad and then back to Israel to be a tank instructor and then back to Berkeley to do your PhD. Yes, correct. True story. And so- And then now you\\'re back in Israel again. Why can\\'t I make a decision? Yes. And so I did it a bit backwards and I actually decided that for my military service, not like there\\'s, there\\'s not a ton of like, flexibility in what you do, but like, there\\'s some and I decided that I want to, I wanted to try out to do something that was like, very different from anything that I would ever do. I said, I\\'m probably gonna be in an office for the rest of my life. I want to do something very different. And I also want to do something that\\'s like kind of scary to me that like, I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ll fail at it. I think it\\'ll be really difficult. It\\'s like comes totally, completely out of my comfort zone because I think that I think that\\'s important.And so, and I said, you know, and the risk here isn\\'t that high. Like worst case, like, I won\\'t be that great in the military, that\\'s fine. And so I tried out to be like an instructor and then specifically I saw a tank. I was like, that machine is amazing. I want that. And so then I like tried out specifically to be a tank instructor. And my, the way that it works is at least then was that they have women that basically we train the soldiers. Where basically in a tank you have you have the gunner, you have the driver, you have the loader, and you have the commander. And my role was basically to train the gunners. And, and then also commanders have to do all of them and, and officers have to know all of them. And so also training like the commanders and, and the officers.And specifically for training the gunners, I was trainer on the weapons subsystems. So basically all of the computers. And that basically helps them like all the computer system within the tank for the weapons subsystem. And it was kind of tricky to do my undergraduate before a military service because I would ask my commanders questions like \"so the algorithm that it uses to understand like what angle to open is that like, does it, does it learn through reinforcement learning or?\", and they were just like, maybe like, what? Who are you? Like what planet did you come from? Like, what are huh? And so that\\'s, that\\'s what I did my military service in. And so it included like, it was like incredibly physically difficult because they basically make us go through you know, I did basic training, had to do like a 1,000,001 pushups run around a lot the outside, not sleep, learn how to, basically I was trained on all of the subsistence of the tank, not only the gunners, basically to learn everything that goes on there and then focus in on one.Because I only got, basically after you do basic training, after you learn everything, that\\'s only, only after that. Then they\\'re like, okay, now you\\'re gonna focus on this. And it basically checked all the boxes of being like really, really hard, incredibly challenging. Turns out physical isn\\'t the tough, isn\\'t the tough part. It\\'s like mentally very, very difficult. And so that kind of set me up to being kind of less afraid of failure because it\\'s tough. After that I was a preschool teacher which was by far, by far the most difficult job I\\'ve ever had by far, by far. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Wow. I even, as you were saying that, I thought you were gonna say, like, I had this idea of like cuddles and like laughter, like how much nicer that would be then. Yes. Tons of cuddles, tons of, tons of cuddles, tons of laughter, but like, so physically draining. And like, so emotionally, like, you know, I would dream about my kids and like, it never leaves you like you dream about these kids and you\\'re thinking about them and like they, you know and I was also like more sick than I\\'ve ever been, like, constantly sick. I was like always on like, some sort of antibiotics. No, but it, it\\'s like very, very challenging. But it\\'s also you know, it gives you, it\\'s also another way to do something that\\'s like really tough and gives you a different perspective. And it\\'s both the military and being a preschool teacher are incredibly, incredibly humbling. Like very, very humbling. And so I think that\\'s like the biggest takeaway for me of those things that, that I did.And now wait, wait. I need to tie it back in to Women in STEM. So, now I\\'m a mom. I have three kids. I have a two-year-old and almost five-year-old, and like less than a month five-year-old, and an eight-year-old. And so first of all, if I\\'m tying it all into like content moderation, why I do what I do, I think it\\'s like extremely obvious. Like you know, online harm can turn into offline harm. And I do want to make sort of all interactions safer. And in terms of like, I see my daughter and I see the world she\\'s, she\\'s eight and like, what it means to be, to be a woman in this world and a leader in this world.And I want to make sure that she has role models so that she isn\\'t the only woman in her computer science class, been there. So that she has, you know, she isn\\'t the only woman in meetings, been there. I want to make sure that she has like a much more welcoming environment for whatever she, for whatever she wants to do. And what\\'s really sad to me is that even now there\\'s like I\\'m hearing from her things like, oh, well, you know, boys are better at that than me. No, not true, very not true. Here\\'s why it\\'s not true. And so these are the kinds of things that like, I want to, first of all, I want to make sure that they\\'re, they\\'re not out there online. These kinds of you know, speaking of disinformation, but also want to make sure that sort of the environment that she\\'s growing up into is, is much more welcoming. Nice. Well, it\\'s cool to hear how you are, you know, your passions are coming through across all aspects of your life and that you\\'re tying together you know, these personal things, these, the personal things that you\\'d like to see in the world with what you\\'re doing professionally with respect to things like disinformation. So we were talking about you being in Israel, obviously that\\'s come up a number of times at this episode and the military service. Another thing that is unique about Israel is that it has very high R&D expenditure per capita. So it is markedly higher than any other nation on the planet. And so that probably creates an interesting flywheel between the strong tech startup ecosystem that there is in Israel. So that, you know, helps generate more things that R&D can be spent on.But another interesting piece related to this is that I can\\'t remember if this was a podcast conversation that I had in the past. I don\\'t think it was. So I think this is the first time we talked about it on air, but my understanding is that another thing that\\'s fueling tech startups in Israel is this mandatory military service. So you went and did tank instruction, but a lot of people particularly I suspect a lot of people that already had undergraduate degrees like you did, end up doing things that aren\\'t, you know, you know, they\\'re, they\\'re not training to be on the front lines and more, they\\'re training how to do threat intelligence. They\\'re training how to do signal detection, they\\'re using machine learning and data analysis in the field. And then, so having developed that skillset for several years, when you finish it, you\\'re like, well what could I do? And one idea that I guess a lot of these people have is, well, I could be making a startup I could be using, using these technology skills in industry.So so we have these flywheels of, I guess there\\'s two flywheels here. There\\'s one where the mandatory military training creates leads people to be tech entrepreneurs. And then that probably in turn also is helpful for military capabilities in general. And then you have this separate flywheel of R&D where this strong tech ecosystem is a self-fulfilling prophecy of, \"oh, great, you know, we should be investing more in this.\" And so then more people go into that. And yeah, so I\\'ve, I\\'ve now talked a lot, a lengthy transition. The floor is yours. So yes, yes, and yes. So yeah, we have mandatory military service. It\\'s currently set at on like in general, roughly speaking, two years for women, three years for men. Again, with lots and lots of caveats. And in and there\\'s sort of, first of all, there\\'s definitely like a big investment of the military in technology, whether it\\'s like signal processing or AI or whatever. And so then you have people that are basically trained in that, like you said, and then they can go out and they have this skillset set, and we, we hire people, you know, everyone\\'s hiring those sets of people, but even people that aren\\'t going into these sorts of fields, the fact that there\\'s this mandatory military service means that already from a young age, you\\'re in a place where you\\'re picking up skills that are necessary to succeed in, you know, in these companies, right?So, for example, leadership skills, right? Like you can go basically in most cases, in order to become an officer in our military, you have to start at the bottom. Like, it\\'s not like in the US where you have like West Point and the Naval Academy or whatever, and then, and then that\\'s how you become an officer. Basically you start when you\\'re 18, and then based on different parameters, you can, you can be, you can elect or you can be chosen to do officer\\'s training. And so then you have these people that are, that are leaving the military with a skillset set of, you know, being like very focused, you know, focused and leadership skills and managerial skills and time management skills, and all these things that basically like, oh, that\\'s for a successful entrepreneur or a successful CEO.And so yes, it\\'s one of them is like on the job training. And the other one is just like in general, these like other skills they need to have. And another thing that I think is really positive about the fact that it\\'s a sort of mandatory military services, that it\\'s sort of this like equalizing force, right? So everyone goes into the military, almost, huge caveat, which is like causing right now a lot of social unrest here, but we\\'ll leave that for a different, for a different time. But you go into the military and you\\'re mixed with different people, right? And so that\\'s also a way of like meeting people that you wouldn\\'t necessarily otherwise meet, then kind of out of your, you know, echo chamber out of your specific place. And then that can also be like a very like an incubator for like new relationships that can then go off and, and start new companies. And then yes, I think the fact that we have a very, very strong investment in R&D is also, like you said, the self-fulfilling prophecy. Like what do people want to go end up doing? What do people end up doing is they go to this field, right? It\\'s like, that\\'s, that\\'s what we know. That\\'s what we see. That\\'s, that\\'s, that\\'s sort of like that\\'s also a very good way for upward mobility for, for people. And so with our field in particular with data science, do you think that all of this R&D in Israel will give Israel an edge in AI technology in particular? Yeah, so I, yes, absolutely. I think that already we\\'re seeing that. So I have people that I, that I work with one of which like it, she used to be like very, very senior in the military and in AI. She\\'s, I work with her very closely. She\\'s, she\\'s our VPI product noit. And so she was very, very senior in the military and building AI infrastructure capability. So there\\'s already this sort of cross-pollination. We also have people that either, like I said, we hire right out of the military, or in some rare cases we have people that sort of start doing their studies first before, right? The military says, okay, like, you can take this time. You know, we pay for your studies and then you sign on for a certain amount of time later for the military.And in some cases we can also hire these people while they\\'re in their studies. And then the skills that they learn with us, they can then go and use in the military. So there is this, this definite cross-pollination that we\\'re seeing. And I think that it also definitely puts, you know, there\\'s, puts AI as like a very, very strong and core component of the industry here because it\\'s so useful, not only in the military, right, but in general in all of the companies that are going on. And so there\\'s like this very, very rich community here of, you know, researchers, practitioners, and so forth. Great answer, crystal clear and exciting to see what ActiveFence and other AI companies will be doing out of Israel in the coming years and the coming decades. This has been an awesome episode, Matar. So I was promised that you were this extraordinary speaker and you have proved to be an amazing communicator. It\\'s been a real joy to speak to you. Thank you. And so I\\'m sure our audience loved this conversation as well. Thank you. And so we covered a lot of interesting topics, automated harmful content detection, neuroscience, military service, preschoolers, so I\\'m sure our listeners will want to hear more from you. So first my penultimate question that I always ask guests is whether you have a book recommendation for our audience? Of course. So this has nothing to do with anything that we talked about. But I really like the book Under the Banner of Heaven. It\\'s by Jon Krakauer who wrote Into the Wild. I think. Oh yeah, I\\'ve heard that. I love reading books about sort of like other, other lives or other, other places. And so Under the Banner of Heaven is, is a good one. Nice. Yeah, Jon Krakauer is a, an outstanding author based on Into the Wild, so I\\'m sure that that\\'s a great recommendation. He\\'s also, he\\'s an annoying person for me when I start typing my name into Google. Oh, that\\'s true. He\\'s the one who comes up until I get to the \"o\" in my last name. So always reminded of him. Maybe that\\'s what primed me to think of that book of all books I could recommended. There you go. And yeah, and then my final question for you is how should people follow you and glean more insights from you after the program? So, I\\'m on LinkedIn, like everyone. I also, we have a R&D tech blog for ActiveFence. It\\'s engineering.activefence.com, and that\\'s where you can read more about the things that we do and dive into some more, some more details. And please feel free to shoot me an email or reach out to me on LinkedIn. I\\'m always happy to chat. Nice. Thank you for making that offer to our listeners, Matar, and thank you so much for being on the program, especially on such short notice we booked you just days before recording this episode. Oh, don\\'t say that. It makes it seem like I have no life. Yeah, right. Yeah, as I mean, it actually, it just shows, you know, how kind you were to make this time because you\\'ve got three kids, you are the VP of Data and AI at a very fast growing high valued company. And so thank you for making the time despite that to fit our SuperDataScience listeners in. Happy to. Nice. Well, yeah, so you mentioned potentially being on the show again the future, and that sounds great to me. We can hear about how ActiveFence continues to shape this harmful content reduction space in the years to come. Thanks, Matar. Thank you for having me. This was fascinating and a lot of fun. I loved this conversation today. I hope you did too. In today\\'s episode, Matar filled us in on how an ML model such as a binary classifier can become Contextual by taking into account additional context. For example, we can pull out a logo from an image, identify the individual in an image, and compare it with a database. We can examine natural language comments and consider the content poster\\'s history and graph-network affiliations. She also talked about how real-time streaming of harmful content presents unique challenges that can be addressed by smaller models on edge devices like phones, sampling on servers, and again, taking into account context.
