       "'This is Five Minute Friday episode number 40: Get in touch.Welcome and congratulations. Episode number 40. Can you imagine it\\'s already been 40 episodes and we\\'ve had over 30 guests on the show? 32 guests, to be precise, have come on this show to share their knowledge, experience, expertise, philosophies, world views, with you. And I hope you\\'ve had a great time. We\\'ve done 40 episodes and we\\'re going to do many, many more. We\\'ve got so many interesting plans ahead, so many interesting people I want to get onto this show, so many interesting discussions I would like to have and share with you. And today\\'s episode is a quick Five Minute Friday to announce something new that we\\'re doing.Sometimes I get messages from people, and this is starting to become more and more often. I\\'m getting messages from people saying, \"Hey Kirill, that was a really cool discussion, really enjoyed that specific discussion with that specific guest. I wish you could ask this question next time.\" Or, you know, \"It made me think of this thing, and next time you have a guest on that other topic, could you ask this question?\" And I have gotten quite a few -- well, not a lot right now -- but I would like to get even more questions like that from you guys which I can pass on to the audience.And I\\'ve already passed a couple of them, I think I\\'ve asked at least two questions on the podcast that people have submitted to me via different means, whether it\\'s LinkedIn or somewhere else. And a lot of the time, because I get quite a lot of messages across the media, these things can get lost. So we\\'ve set up a special email where you can email your questions. So if you have any cool, interesting, exciting questions you would like to ask our guests, and I have a feeling that a lot of you do, you just don\\'t know where to send them, well now you have a place to send them. Send them to the following email:podcast@superdatascience.com. So SuperDataScience is one word, as you probably already know by now, so podcast@superdatascience.com. Send your questions there and we will review them, and the most interesting ones we\\'ll ask our guests.So if we have enough questions, I\\'ll try to ask at least one question at the end of the podcast, and I\\'ll actually say your name, say who the question is from, and then you\\'ll be able to show off to your friends that your question was asked to some influencer, or even anybody who is on the show in the space of data science. and another cool thing about this new feature is that if you have a person you know who would be good for the podcast, please send their recommendation, or recommend them to us through this email as well.So just send their name and a brief description of why you think that person would be a great fit for the podcast. You don\\'t even have to do the introduction right away, just send maybe their LinkedIn profile or some description, something that you know about them and you\\'ve heard about them. Maybe it\\'s your colleague, friends, professor. Maybe it\\'s your manager, maybe it\\'s somebody you\\'ve worked with in the past, maybe it\\'s somebody you\\'ve just heard of at a conference, or you\\'ve heard them speak at a conference. So send them along to podcast@superdatascience.com. Send their details to podcast@superdatascience.com, and once again we\\'ll review those and we\\'ll reach out to them and also let us know if you can make the introduction, then just give us a heads up so that we don\\'t just reach out on our own, but we ask you to make the introduction. It\\'s always easier that way to connect with people.But in any case, don\\'t be afraid to send these things over. We\\'ll definitely review them and maybe we\\'ll have your friend or colleague or whoever you want on the show, we might have them on the show some time soon.So there you go, the email is again podcast@superdatascience.com. Send us any questions you\\'d like me to ask our guests and send us details of any guests that you\\'d like to see on the show. And I hope to get some very interesting ideas from you some time soon. And on that note, thank you so much for being a listener on this podcast. I appreciate you and your time so much, and I really hope you have a fantastic weekend ahead. Go out there, enjoy life, enjoy the outdoors, enjoy whatever you\\'re doing this weekend, and I can\\'t wait to see you next time. Until then, happy analyzing.'"
