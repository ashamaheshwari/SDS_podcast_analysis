For those who are still not over DataScienceGO 2018, here’s an episode to relive it!About the guestsThe panel includes:\\nMark Skinner, the Solutions Architect at NVIDIARachel Shuyan Wang, the Manager of Data Science at TrueCar, Inc.Ben Taylor, the Chief AI Officer at ZIFF, Inc.Pablos Holman, Hacker, Inventor, Entrepreneur and Technology FuturistOverviewMake sure you’ve got your attentive ears on because it’s going to be jam-packed. Well-regarded data practitioners sit and talk for a panel discussion about the challenges, solutions, and trends in different topics – blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and disruption of startups. They entertained a lot of questions which, for sure, you’re also curious about.\\n\\nOne of the key takeaways from this episode is the need for healthy data culture in companies. Despite how exponential the growth is for the technologies, there are still businesses that are unaware these techs could improve their systems and operations. And, if by chance, there are companies that are aware, it might be hard to incorporate these techs because, in the first place, their decision-making is not based on data. If there is a data culture inside the company, it’s already easy to adapt and progress from there.\\n\\nThe 4 panelists also answered a lot of questions about blockchain & cryptocurrency. Is cryptocurrency here to stay? Will it topple the banking industry? The decentralized transaction is always the selling point of the blockchain technology. Cryptocurrency is here to stay for people who want a level playing field. The crypto toolkit is also growing; it’s not just blockchain anymore.\\n\\nIn terms of AI & Machine Learning, they say we should worry less about the threats but worry more about how the media gets everything wrong. It’s still a developing field and it has already done a lot of improvements. There is still no evidence that these robots could be malevolent.\\n\\nDiscover also how reinforcement learning will have a noticeable edge over supervised learning in the future. Pablos, Mark, Rachel, and Ben also share their own failed stories while starting and growing startups where you could all learn from. And, when asked about the technologies they were excited about, here are what they answered:\\n\\nBen – Generative adversarial network (GANs) which can help businessesMark – the self-driving ability of carsRachel – virtual reality (VR)Pablos – sewing robots in garment manufacturingWe just touched the tip of the iceberg so make sure to listen in. And, if you’ve missed DataScienceGO 2018, now’s the time to catch up with the latest news and trends from these experts!\\n\\nIn this episode you will learn:Introduction of Speakers.
